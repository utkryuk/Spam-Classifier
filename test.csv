hey i have a problem:
i have a rpms that i have installed that i want to uninstall, i do it
like so:
rpm -e [rpm package]
and it gives the error: package not installed, so i install it like
so:
rpm -i [rpm package]
and it gives the error: package already installed, so i force it to
install like so:
rpm -i --force [rpm package]
this installs it and then i try to uninstall it again and it still
gives me the same error: package not installed.
 
How can i get it to recognize that the package is indeed installed it,
and/or get it to unstall it?
 
Thanx in advance,
Brian French

X-Spam-Level: 

I'm not sure if this is really a razor problem/issue or a sendmail
problem. Here's the scenario... My mail server is a 150mhz PC funning
FreeBSD 4.4. Ordinarily, the machine is quite idle; it supports my
wife's web site with Apache server running on it and a few other
services (jabber, etc). Between the various members of our family, we
get a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). On
occasion, our DSL-based ISP dies for a number of hours. When we get a
reconnection to the Internet, I get a huge flow of emails coming in
which are then filtered via razor. As a result, I will sometimes see
over 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such an
occasion. The machine is then REALLY slow.

I noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associated
with the call to razor-check. There was something in the log, though,
to make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor
files. So I have just added ""-home /etc/razor"" as an argument. I
haven't had any down time since then so I cannot comment on whether
this change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount. (This
paragraph may be an aside to my real problem, the first paragraph
above; but I thought I should be complete in my description.)

At any rate, has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email
processing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes?  Is there,
perhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes?

Any ideas would be welcome.

Thanks,
Joe

Wow, Finnish seems even more complicated than German to me :-)
Could you send an English translation next time? I really didn't understand
a thing and I assume I'm not the only one ;-)

Considering 90% of the fake job posting I see are for embedded systems or
device drivers - C still rules the world.

The problem is the problem you're trying to solve is never the same. Java
will soon suffer API-rot (alot of poeple are already complaining about it),
it's just new. C was clean in the beginning too. API-rot is PURELY a
function of age.

I do this all the time, It's alot easier then you think if the original
programmer had a clue at all... Java does remove the clue requirement tho,
just adds a huge testing requirement, QA guys aren't as cheap ;)

No it's not, but you can hire teams of Javites for cheap at your local high
school. Java is about cutting costs and commoditizing programming - and it's
working!

I am Mr.IKE EJOH. Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6  1999 a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATIONMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  employers, the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called GLOBAL& BASIC FINANCIAL COMPANY., I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company. i shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes  and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate & administration in your favour. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Bran
ch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please replyimmediately via the private email address . Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: 

Thanks and regards. 

MR.IKE EJOH

I am trying to manage the email for a domain which I have hosted with
hosting365, and am trying to get the whole email send and receive thing
working nice and easily.
At the moment I have configured Fetchmail to poll the different pop3
mailboxes and deliver the mail accordingly, although it appears that I have
to have only one unix user being able to receive from each pop3 mailbox.
This could be a limitation of the fetchmailconf programme, I'm not sure, but
It would be much handier if I could just tell it to collect all of the mail
from the different mailboxes, and then deliver it locally according to the
""To:"" header instead of the pop3 mailbox it came from.
The other issue I am having is sending outgoing mail.  I have been trying to
use sendmail, but am finding it to be an absolute pain in the posterior, and
when the relay server will only accept outgoing connections if I have
checked for incoming mail in the last twenty minutes, and I don't know how
to set sendmail to run a command before it sends out the mail.  Do any of
the outgoing mailer programs, exim or postfix or whatever, have a 'nice'
configuration interface, or do they all have nice friendly configuration
files like sendmail.

Any suggestions of alternative solutions would be much appreciated.  There
are only three or four email addresses in my domain, and setting it up for
scheduled collection and either scheduled or immediate delivery would do me
fine.

Thanks,

	David.

Hi Folks,

I have just installed spamassassin 2.31 in my postfix MTA server.

At first, I would like to test it just in my email account before 
applying it to the wole site.

I configured just as in the INSTALL file:

	5. Create a .forward...
	""|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #user""
	6. create a .procmailrc
	:0fw
	| /usr/bin/spamassassin -c 
			/etc/mail/spamassassin/rules

But the spams get trought it untouched. When I run it by the hand:

cat sample-spam.txt | /usr/bin/spamassassin -c 
				/etc/mail/spamassassin/rules

it does tag it as spam and send me the email.

what should I look at?

Thank you,

Across my data, all-caps DATE, SUBJECT, TO, etc indeed appear only in the
spam collections.  OTOH, they don't appear often -- less than 1% of spam
messages have at least one of these all-cap header lines.  But when I'm
fighting what are now sub-1% f-n rates, even rare clues can help!

Sure it is - it tends to bring out the people who let ""hysterical
right wing propaganda"" spew forth, while reaching for their gun 
whenever a ""liberal"" enters the room.

my hysterical left wing ""propaganda"" is generally an emotional
reaction on a mailing list, not an organizaed attempt at converting
people's thinking through lies and distortion (as was the original
article). 

Whereas your constant and predictable brandings of my postings are, to
 my mind, a deliberate and reasoned  effort to reduce debate, and
 discourage left of center postngs.

Okay....Catchup unseen is something that I don't use often, but i can 
certainly reproduce this.  I'll dig into it.  It's probably simple.

The first part of this doesn't really fit, except in isolated cases - 
certainly not en mass. The second part though... Hmm...

Well, think about it.

We already have weapons of mass destruction, but are actively developing 
bigger and better ones.

Heheh... Anyone know about the 'School of the Americas'? What about the 
monies, supplies, and training that supported the contra rebels? Oh, I 
forgot, their government was ""bad"" and needed to be overthrown (with out 
help).

Basic human values like the first ammendment? The fourth ammendment?

Sorry, Shrub, your political newspeak is falling on deaf ears. Oh, 
sorry, maybe I should self-censor my thoughts to avoid being put in a 
're-education camp' by Ashcrofts gestappo? Gads, maybe someone on FoRK 
has joined your T.I.P.S. program and became an official citizen spy?


In disgust,

<div class=Section1>


<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>CONSANTLY</b> being
bombarded by so-called FREE money-making systems that teases you with limited
information, and when its all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding your
money/credit card information upfront in some slick way,<b> after-the-fact</b>!
Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general with
all its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main business
slowed-down (<i>I have been self-employed all my life</i>), so I looked for
something to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying my
bills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, this
proposal to try something new without any upfront investment (<i>great! because
I had none</i>) interested me to click on the link provided. And I dont regret
at all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you as
a system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You join
only if (<i>when</i>) you make money. You also get to track the results of your
time and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea of
personal control with real-time, staying informed statistics.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>This system is quite simply
the most logical, opened, and fair of any others that Ive seen before. Why?
Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriously
consider if this is right for you.  No teasing. No grand testimonies! No
kidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you no idea of
their overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worst
yet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying to
figure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing you
with the two things you really must know: <u>Whats it all about</u>? and <u>How
does it work</u>?. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers that
need to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you dont
want to do that; by then you are hooked and now locked into a frustrating
battle to try to get your money back! </b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I call this my Platinum
Choice because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totally
different from previously misleading, hook-first programs that promise lofty
mega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their own
pockets! Youve seen the headlines: <u>Join free and Make $10,000 every week
for life</u> yeah, right!</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I did not make millions yet,
but the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happy
with my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldnt be able to do anything
without corporate help  which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>You have to see this in action
for yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out the
form as soon as you can. You will get your own site in a few minutes. Then you
are ready to try whether you can make some decent money with this system and
the Internets explosive potential - fully loaded with hi-tech software, free
corporate help, on-time members support and even protective safeguards! </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>Get it now, and you can call me
at any time with questions. It really could help you like it is helping me to
finally be able to pay my bills, and keep my free time free.  Good luck!</p>

Britons stand tall, if slightly heavy, in Europe

John Carvel, social affairs editor
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The Guardian

Not every European dimension has been harmonised in Brussels yet. According
to the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,
shoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.
The figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of
anthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the
University of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit
people's shape.
The volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the
inner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below
the buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.
It has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)
taller than his French counterpart.
The mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men
only the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height
advantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.
The average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared
with 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and
1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and
Americans 1,626.7mm
More disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other
nationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men
and 66.7 for women.
The average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7
inches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and
806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of
1,047.2mm.
The average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second
largest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably
smaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.
The average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than
the French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the
Swedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively
outstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.
However Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm
compared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,
compared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.
The DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the
available evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm
longer than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American
average.
The British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German
counterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.
Beverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for
occupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.
The department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to
open ring pull cans.

    ""apt-get install xine"".  It'll find all these.  Oh, and I'm told that Redhat 8.0 will also suggest things like this for ya. (Not apt, but the actual package names you need)

Hi,

Just the kind of announce I make once in a while :
- I've rebuilt a new ""alsaplayer"" package based on Angle's one.
- I've rebuilt a hopefully final version ""-fr8"" of the ""alsa-driver"" and
  ""alsa-kernel"" packages which fix all known SMP build issues.

Both can be found here :
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/

I've also repackaged gkrellm 2.0.2 with at last a separate package for the
server that can be installed standalone and doesn't even require glib2.
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/gkrellm/

Last but not least, my latest proftpd 1.2.6 package incorporates some nifty
new features : You can use any of ""--with ldap"", ""--with mysql"" and ""--with
postgres"" when rebuilding the source rpm with rpmbuild to enable desired
extra authentication methods and all package requirements are set
accordingly, and the release tag is changed too.
http://valhalla.freshrpms.net/ (the usual place ;-))

I think I'll use this ""--with <whatever>"" switch more and more where
possible. Some other of my package already use it like the xmame for its
output targets, sqlrelay for its modules and my latest sylpheed claws spec
to enable Pilot support.

As usual, feedback and comments are welcome! :-)

Matthias

PS: Yup, I'm back from my holidays ;-)

EMAIL-smith_j@mailsurf.com
23TH OF August 2002

ATTN:PRESIDENT/CEO


                    STRICTLY PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL
I am MR.Johnson S. Abu, the bills and exchange Director at the
ForeignRemittance Department of the Central Bank of Nigeria.  I am 
writingyou
this letter to ask for your support and cooperation to carrying thisbusiness
opportunity in my department.  We discovered abandoned the sumof
US$37,400,000.00 (Thirty seven million four hundred thousand unitedstates
dollars) in an account that belong to one of our foreign customers,an
American
late Engr. John Creek (Junior) an oil merchant with the federal government
of
Nigeria who died along with his entire family of a wifeand two children in
Kenya Airbus (A310-300) flight KQ430 in November2000.

Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next of kin tocome
over
and put claims for his money as the heir, because we cannotrelease the fund
from his account unless someone applies for claims asthe next  of kin to the
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately, neither
their
family member nor distant relative hasappeared to claim the said fund.  Upon
this discovery, I and other officialsin my department have agreed to make
business with you release the totalamount into your account as the heir of
the
fund since no one came forit or discovered either maintained account with
our
bank, other wisethe fund will be returned to the bank treasury as unclaimed
fund.

We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus: 30%for
you as
foreign partner and 70% for us the officials in my department.

Upon the successful completion of this transfer, my colleague and I
willcome to
your country and mind our share. It is from our 60% we intendto import
computer
accessories into my country as way of recycling thefund.  To commence this
transaction we require you to immediately indicateyour interest by calling
me
or sending me a fax immediately on the aboveTelefax # and enclose your
private
contact Telephone #, Fax #, full nameand address and your designated
banking co-
 ordinates to enable us fileletter of  claim to the appropriate department
for
necessary approvalsbefore the transfer can be made.

Note also, this transaction must be kept strictly confidential becauseof its
nature.

NB: Please remember to give me your Phone and Fax No

MR.Johnson Smith  Abu

  | so I'll probably poke around at the sequences performance issues,

Well, there's this wonderful piece of code in MhSeqExpand ...

    # Hack to weed out sequence numbers for messages that don't exist
    foreach m $rseq {
        if ![file exists $mhProfile(path)/$folder/$m] {
            Exmh_Debug $mhProfile(path)/$folder/$m not found
            set ix [lsearch $seq $m]
            set seq [lreplace $seq $ix $ix]
        } else {
            # Real hack
            break
        }
    }

which is going to run slow if a sequence happens to start with a bunch
of messages that don't exist.   I'm not sure why it is important that the
first message in the sequence returned exists, but not necessarily any
of the others, but I'm sure glad it is, as MhSeqExpand gets called lots,
and I don't know if I could cope if it were checking every file in the
sequences it is looking at, all the time...

It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current
folder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the
directory).   Does tcl have a directory read function?   I assume so...

Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the
context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.

  | I'll email anything I figure out since I'm leaving town in less 
  | than 48 hours.

Have a good vacation.

1. Perl script fetches POP mail from a distant server
2. mail is fed to SA, running as a standalone module in my user account
3. SA spits out results back to perl script.
4. Script deletes offending mail.

I don't have root access.  I don't need a MTA.

Sounds a bit like The Avalanches, but that will change soon.

having great fun trying to find a dumb ADSL modem with Ethernet
presentation, everybody wants to sell routers but I intend on doing pppoe
from another device, something with more than one Ethernet port would be
nice.
anybody got any recommendations ?

Ted Rall: My Government Went to Afghanistan and All I Got Was This Stupid 
Pipeline[1] 

Summary: The US begun planning courting the Taliban for permission to build an 
oil pipeline since 1997. We even flew Mullah Omar to Texas to try and convince 
him. After it was clear that wouldn't work, we threatened to bomb them and 
begun attacking on a smaller scale for a year before 9-11. We already planned 
to invade two months before the attacks. While it's not clear they knew about 
9-11 it certainly provided a convenient cover for their plans. 

Three days after we started bombing, we begun official work on the pipeline 
Karzai, the Afghanistan president we installed (who incidentally used to work 
for the oil company Unocal and was a former Talib) focused on the pipeline 
rather than rebuilding his torn country. Yet, the entire pipeline is unworkable 
because it's too expensive and will be sabotaged by warlords and Pakistan. 

Bin Laden was essentially a venture capitalist: he funded attacks but didn't 
carry them out. It's far more likely that an Egyptian group, Islamic Jihad, 
carried out the attacks. If we wanted to stop the terrorists, we should have 
gone after them. If we wanted to stop anti-Americanism, we should have gone 
after Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Instead, our bombing created the perfect 
opportunity for Bin Laden to escape. Nor did we bother to stabilize 
Afghanistan, the country is as ruined as ever. 

""Unfortunately, our government seized the moment as well, not to do good or 
right, but to take advantage--of our grief, of our naivete, of our lust for 
justice and vengeance. They did it to line the pockets of themselves and their 
friends, to gain political and economic advantage for a tiny coterie of 
influential people. In doing so, they endangered the rest of us. They took 
advantage of our ignorance about Islam, Caspian Sea oil and remote Central 
Asia. I have faith that the fundamental goodness of the American people will 
cause them to see what was done in their name, and to do something about it.""

Normally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated 
with fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be 
the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but 
related, relaxation techniques including ""betagenics"", 
hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I 
obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / 
G-Force Dyno-Staff.

I have to say however that, having found this while looking for 
something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I 
particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the 
Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.

To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular 
seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some 
religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very 
irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and 
contrast with our (my) modern mental models.

I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and 
justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.

We create the world we live in.
A loving person lives in a loving world,
A hostile person lives in a hostile world.
Everyone you meet is your mirror.

You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence 
as when you give offence. To be upset over what you don't have is to 
waste what you do have.

The past is dead,
The future is imaginary,
Happiness can only be
in the Eternal Now Moment

How soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is the 
direct experience that there's nothing you need that you don't have.

Love a person because he or she is there.
This is the only reason.

Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions 
and demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences.

The
purpose
of our lives
is to be free
of all addictive traps,
and thus
become one
with the ocean of
Living Love.

OK, gotcha.

I don't think you can do that with exmh, but you can do it on the
command line, if you use sh or ksh:

	for f in `folders -fast -r`
	do
		echo sorting $f ...
		sortm +$f
	done

It could take a long time.

At work, I have to use Outlook.  Ick.  I hate it.  But it does a few
things right.  Like making indices for each folder, and not just by
date, but also by sender, message size, subject.  So I can sort by any
column instantly.

I believe this is possible, too, with an IMAP compliant reader,
provided the IMAP server makes such indices.

I am facing the fact that exmh has been left behind in some industry
standards.  I use it for my personal mail.  My mail server runs unix,
and I connect over ssh and tunnel my X traffic over ssh.  With a slow
link, this makes exmh very slow.  And mime handling is pretty bad
compared with modern mailers.  I am just scared to move.  I've been
using MH or nmh since 1985 and exmh since 1995.  17 years is a long
time!

Oops - turns out i wasn't careful installing it, so the exmh(library)
variable was pointing at my old installation.  I'm surprised it worked
as well as it did.

In any case, I removed the old library directory, and edited exmh,
exmh-bg, exmh-strip, etc to point at the right one.  Now I'm getting
another traceback on startup:

can't read ""mhPriv(pubseq,family,cur)"": no such variable
    while executing
""MhSeq $folder $seq add $mhPriv(pubseq,$folder,$seq) [MhSeqExpand

    invoked from within

    (""after"" script)


+family is the folder I was in when I quit exmh.

I'm on a remote display right now, and its really slow.  I'll have to
play with it more tonight when I get home to see if there are any
other problems.

You are not still using sourceforge, are you? If you have any hopes that they 
are anything but yet another business giving away a free service, then see 
this: Selling Microsoft VisualStudio on the ""open source development platform"". 
Nice touch. Click on the image for the original screenshot....

Im feeling a bit farklempt having spent the night at Todais with the
family so talk amongst yourself..here Ill give you a topic

The current state of IT can be thought of in terms of the Cold war with
the US and the UUSR being MS and Sun/IBM/OSS (does it matter which side

------- Additional Comments From daniel@roe.ch  2002-08-28 09:15 -------
3. usage of <p> just like <br> (ie. without </p>) which is obsolete
   (not sure whether some mailers still produce such broken html)
4. tag argument values sometimes enclosed in """", sometimes not
5. colour args without # in front of hex rgb code
6. colour args with non-6-digit rgb code (typo)
7. onMouseOver et al in nonconsistent case throughout the document

Mind, those are just ideas. I'm pretty sure some or even most of them
are not working in practice, but they might be worth checking out.

""Expect a 3 percent to 5 percent boost with PC1066""

5% faster for only 4 times [pricewatch at 7:55PM - 93 vs 379] the cost.

Gimme gimme gimme! And I better get the full 5% speedup.

And gime me that 20% faster GeForce 4600 at twice the cost of the 4200 too.

Seriously, who falls for this scam?

P.S. finished the PS2 port, it benchmarks at fp:1 int:40. a celeron 525
benches at fp:460 int:400... If it's not a polygon fill the thing is
useless. There will be no beowolf cluster of these. It is 3x faster then
the iPaq tho at 1/13 :)

Rael is plagued by MSIE instability on Mac OS X. I use a recent nightly build 
of Chimera as my default browser. 0.4 has some issues with plugins (or with

While I was playing with the past issues, it annoyed me that there was
no easy way to make the log stop growing (I don't mean to truncate it,
I mean to just freeze it for a while).

The following patch adds a new button to the log window, which allows
the log to be switched on/off (the button says ""Disable"" when the
log is enabled, and the button disables it, and ""Enable"" when the log
is frozen, and the button enables it again).

Yes, you read the links.

Sorry, but exposing folly is not only humorous but also instructive.  It
is only by exposing folly to ridicule that you stop it in the first
place.

'Brickbats' leans heavily on both, though the item I highlighted was a
'horror' item not a 'gee that is stupid' item.  For an example of the
latter, see the city that wanted a woman to pay a ticket for parking in
an UNmarked no-parking space.

Wow, I've got a great idea!  I'll hire a skywriter to write ""you can't

This was poking fun of the practice of making
up differnt types of speech with different
types of protected status.  I think the
laws specialing out hate and protected speech
are ridiculous.  The point I keep trying to make
is that there's only two types, speech and action. 
I agree, they are all speech and should be 
covered by the First Amendment, but

If hate speech is so protected, why are certain
states trying to prosecute people for it?  There's
only two answers and one of them is wrong.

  1) Because hate speech is different and needs to
     have a different level of protection dictated
     by whoever's offended at the time.
  2) It's because it's not just speech, but action.
     A action who's consequences are foreseeable by 
     any reasonable person. 

Hate speech is mislabeled.  It's really ""threat"".  I think
they let the mislabeling perpetuate as there's advantage
in being able to counter-threat with loss of liberty and
money through civil and criminal lawsuits for people THEY
don't like.

A lot of spam which *appears* to originate from China, and even 
a lot which advertises websites hosted there, is sent by, and is 
done for the benefit of, companies based in the US.  The spam 
often appears to originate there because it's coming from open 
http, or squid proxy servers.  It's hosted there because these 
spammers are now persona-non-grata on all US ISPs.  One hardly 
needs to involve the Chinese government in a case where a US 
citizen is violating US law.

The first court cases were actually concluded years ago. These 
include many legal precedents which are used to protect the 
rights of ISPs to block mail, and to terminate service to 
spammers.

Surprising then, how much information you can find on the 
current whereabouts of long-time spammers like Alan Ralksy of 
Detroit, Michigan.  Ralsky is a guy who even gives interviews to 
the news media.  If you can connect a specific corpus of spam to 
him, his street address is well known. Ralsky is a prime 
candidate for lawsuits in any state with an anti-spam law. 
Thomas Cowles is another long-time spammer, but last I heard 
he'd been jailed for stealing computer equipment from his 
business partner, Eddy Marin (also a long time spammer (You've 
heard of PopLaunch, right?)

Back when I was working at MAPS, there was a flap over a 
pump-and-dump spammer, Rodona Garst.  Seems she had an open 
file-share on her laptop, and when she forged the wrong domain, 
the real owner hacked in and posted all her private information 
on a website. Oh, look, it's still there, including the nude 
photos:

http://belps.freewebsites.com/

I recall this well, because the SEC was VERY interested in 
confirming the validity of the information found online.  There 
were some ""interesting"" conversations. This summer, the SEC 
released the following:

http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8113.htm

Yes, the investigation took two years, but the financial penalty 
for operating a pump-and-dump scam isn't small.  The wheels of 
government grind slow, but the grind very fine indeed.

OK, here's a refinement.  Assuming very little spam comes through, we
only need to pick a small percentage of ham received as new training
ham to match the new training spam.  The program could randomly select
a sufficient number of saved non-spam msgs and ask the user to
validate this selection.  You could do this once a day or week (config
parameter).

Config parameter.

I'm trying to think about the end-user issues because I have nothing
to contribute to the algorithm at this point.  For deployment we need
both!

Some Friends, Indeed, Do More Harm Than Good

September 10, 2002
By MARY DUENWALD 




 

Friends are supposed to be good for you. In recent years,
scientific research has suggested that people who have
strong friendships experience less stress, they recover
more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live
longer than the friendless. They are even less susceptible
to the common cold, studies show. 

But not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,
insult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too
much advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling
attention to the negative health effects of bad friends. 

""Friendship is often very painful,"" said Dr. Harriet
Lerner, a psychologist and the author of ""The Dance of
Connection."" ""In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,
envy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will
rear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing
is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this
is bad for my health and I'm disbanding it."" 

Another book, ""When Friendship Hurts,"" by Dr. Jan Yager, a
sociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,
advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside.
""There's this myth that friendships should last a
lifetime,"" Dr. Yager said. ""But sometimes it's better that
they end."" 

That social scientists would wait until now to spotlight
the dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering
that they have only recently paid close attention to
friendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -
between siblings or parents and children - have been seen
as more important. 

Of course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead
to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And
children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go
bad. 

As a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.
Lerner said, ""Never once have I had anyone write and say my
best friend hits me."" 

Dr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the
University of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,
like a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the
role of friends in emotional and physical health. 

""Now that a marital relationship can't be counted on for
stability the way it was in the past, and because people
are less likely to be living with or near extended family
members, people are shifting their focus to friendships as
a way of building community and finding intimacy,"" said Dr.
Fehr, the author of ""Friendship Processes."" 

Until the past couple of years, the research on friendship
focused on its health benefits. ""Now we're starting to look
at it as a more full relationship,"" said Dr. Suzanna Rose,
a professor of psychology at Florida International
University in Miami. ""Like marriage, friendship also has
negative characteristics."" 

The research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet
measured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said.
So far they have only, through surveys and interviews,
figured out that it is a significant problem. The early
research, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a
friend can be more devastating than experts had thought. 

How can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by
drawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised
pursuit. ""When you think of people who were friends at
Enron,"" she added, ""you can see how friendship can support
antisocial behavior."" 

Betrayal also makes for a bad friendship. ""When friends
split up,"" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of
psychology at the University of South Carolina, ""it is
often in cases where one has shared personal information or
secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.""


Another form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend
suddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. ""It's
more than just pulling away,"" she said. ""The silent
treatment is actually malicious."" 

At least as devastating is an affair with the friend's
romantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.
Lerner's patients. ""I would not encourage her to hang in
there and work this one out,"" Dr. Lerner said. 

A third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults
the other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who
responded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendship
described how, when she was 11, her best friend called her
""a derogatory name."" The woman, now 32, was so devastated
that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with
people ever since, Dr. Yager said. 

Emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,
but it is ""more insidious,"" Dr. Yager said. ""Some people
constantly set up their friends,"" she explained. ""They'll
have a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or
she finds out."" 

Risk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme
kinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the
only ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying
the second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is
overly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person
who meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and
the loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. 

Most common is the promise breaker. ""This includes everyone
from the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but
something always comes up at the last minute to someone who
promises to be there for you when you need them, but then
isn't,"" Dr. Yager said. 

Some friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,
when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons
to dislike the other one. 

""With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to
discover there's something important they don't like about
the other person,"" said Dr. Rose of Florida International.
""One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other
person is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,
it may take even more time for one person to meet the
other's dislike criteria."" 

Whether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,
""depends on how large the injury is."" 

""Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let
something go,"" she added. ""It's also an act of maturity
sometimes to accept another person's limitations."" 

Acceptance should come easier among friends than among
spouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one
friend and do not need a full range of emotional support
from each one. 

But if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where
one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the
friendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is
to pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal
or intimate details of life, and start being too busy to
get together, ever. 

""It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,
but only one to end it,"" Dr. Yager said. 

Friendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far
easier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also
comparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a
bad friendship should leave a person with more time and
appreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. 

""It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have
them in order while you're healthy and your life and work
are going well,"" she said. ""Because when a crisis hits,
when someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your
health insurance, when the universe gives you a crash
course in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and
life-preserving good friendship is.""

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>CONSANTLY</b> being
bombarded by so-called FREE money-making systems that teases you with limited
information, and when its all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding your
money/credit card information upfront in some slick way,<b> after-the-fact</b>!
Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general with
all its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main business
slowed-down (<i>I have been self-employed all my life</i>), so I looked for
something to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying my
bills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, this
proposal to try something new without any upfront investment (<i>great! because
I had none</i>) interested me to click on the link provided. And I dont regret
at all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you as
a system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You join
only if (<i>when</i>) you make money. You also get to track the results of your
time and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea of
personal control with real-time, staying informed statistics.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>This system is quite simply
the most logical, opened, and fair of any others that Ive seen before. Why?
Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriously
consider if this is right for you.  No teasing. No grand testimonies! No
kidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you no idea of
their overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worst
yet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying to
figure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing you
with the two things you really must know: <u>Whats it all about</u>? and <u>How
does it work</u>?. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers that
need to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you dont
want to do that; by then you are hooked and now locked into a frustrating
battle to try to get your money back! </b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I call this my Platinum
Choice because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totally
different from previously misleading, hook-first programs that promise lofty
mega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their own
pockets! Youve seen the headlines: <u>Join free and Make $10,000 every week
for life</u> yeah, right!</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I did not make millions yet,
but the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happy
with my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldnt be able to do anything
without corporate help  which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>You have to see this in action
for yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out the
form as soon as you can. You will get your own site in a few minutes. Then you
are ready to try whether you can make some decent money with this system and
the Internets explosive potential - fully loaded with hi-tech software, free
corporate help, on-time members support and even protective safeguards! </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>Get it now, and you can call me
at any time with questions. It really could help you like it is helping me to

I get problems with the latest nightly build from Spamassassin with
VMailMgr + OMail-Admin. 
It scans the mail and gives it an :

Can someone look at the code for it? Maybe because option -F is gone?

My next (current) task is to complete the corpus I've got - it's currently
got ~ 9000 ham, 7800 spam, and about 9200 currently unsorted. I'm tossing 
up using either hammie or spamassassin to do the initial sort  - previously
I've used various forms of 'grep' for keywords and a little gui thing to 
pop a message up and let me say 'spam/ham', but that's just getting too, too
tedious.

I can't make it available en masse, but I will look at finding some of
the more 'interesting' uglies. One thing I've seen (consider this 
'anecdotal' for now) is that the 'skip' tokens end up in a _lot_ of the 
f-ps.

what takes time and money: noting the amounts of each correction and basing
the refund delivery method on the amount.  yesh, it's silly to spend $.37 (+
labor and materials) for a $.02 refund, but maybe the only alternative right
now is to create dichotomies that require even more time and labor - or keep
the money (see john hall below).  your mailed refund is a function of bulk.

in jax we're on the verge of firing at&t cable for horrible customer service
and over-charging.  what will probably happen: if the amount of overage per
customer is significant (say $30 or more) the refund will go directly to the
customer.  If it's less, the combined total amount will go to the city as
lump sum settlement.

in your case, maybe all the customers could vote on line where they'd like
their lump sum to go.  of courese, they'd have to be notified by mail first.

They are legally required to do that.  I got a similar check because an
insurance company didn't pay a claim quickly enough.  It might have been
$.02.

Although they spent lots more than $.33 to mail you the check, the
alternative seems to be to keep the money.  Do you really want companies
to have a financial incentive to over-bill you 'just a bit' so they
could keep it?  For a company with millions of customers, $.33/customer
starts adding up.

Cool, one less package to maintain :)

One interesting thing about alsaplayer is that RedHat's XMMS package in RH8 will
probably not play mp3 files. But alsaplayer does play mp3s ""out of the box"".

Also, they are developing rapidly in their CVS and looks like their next version
of alsaplaer will be pretty cool, but I have no idea when it will be ready.

The way to debug something like this is to turn on the log (Preferences 
-> Hacking Support -> Debug log enabled) and track the gpg commands 
being issued and the responses.

FWIW, using exmh 2.5 and gpg 1.0.7 I do not have problems sending 
encrypted messages to myself. When I select the message, an xterm 
window pops up asking for the passphrase. I don't recall exmh ever 
asking me for the passphrase from the tty that started exmh nor from a 
dialog box. (But then again, I'm not a heavy gpg user).

""Dave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach
around.  You're supposed to just shut up and take it.""

http://winerlog.inspiredsites.net/

===========

Who's the real monster?


It seems good Ol' Uncle Dave is once again trying to savage anyone that
dares to disagree with him.  It seems Ben, Kevin and Bill are making too
strong a case.  So here we Dave's attempt to fool you into thinking they're
some sort of monsters, violent ones no less.

Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people
are nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their
way.

Yeah sure Dave, whatever you need to believe.

The truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and
improving RSS in general.  Each with their own brand of attitude, to be
sure, but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move
forward.  How is that being monstrous?

Is Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public's
perception of them?  If you haven't already, contact them and ask them how
they feel about this foolishness.

Dave deflects what he can't take the time to understand


It's really quite pitiful.  When normal people don't understand something
they usually try learning about it.  They read up, ask questions and seek
the help of those that understand it.  This before shooting their mouths off
and looking like fools.

What Dave does is just the opposite.

Posts a link to something he doesn't understand
Get's a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand it
Derides the idea as being 'too much trouble' and blogs it.
Expects others to do research for him
Abuses anyone who tries to help him
Pontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issue
Realizes he's been a fool but refuses to correct himself
Plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy
Tries making the educated people look like fools.
Sends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off.
Exposes any private e-mail they write, out of context.
Deflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1
His continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it's use of RDF reveal this to be
true.  Dave doesn't get the idea of the semantic web.  He'd rather have you
follow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth
trying.

One reader wrote to us with a good analogy.  ""It's like that movie The
Poseidon Adventure.  Dave's like the purser ranting and raving that the
passengers should follow him and march toward the bow.  I don't know about
you but I'd rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room.
The ship's fucking sinking and I don't want to be following the idiot.""

Dave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach
around.  You're supposed to just shut up and take it.  After all, why would
good ol' Uncle Dave want to hurt you?  It's all about love, right?  To hell
with asking you if you want to get shafted.  And if you dare complain, he
savages you.  Then he tries to make everyone think you're the one causing
all the trouble.

We've news for you Dave, we're wise to your tactics and we're talking
amongst ourselves about it.  We're routing around you damaging behavoir.
That's where we're coming from.

If you have an example of how you've tried to help Dave, please drop us an
e-mail about it.  We'll keep it strictly confidential of course.  Send it
along to zaphod@egroups.com

Trying to talk with Dave is like trying to wrestle a pig...


The trouble is, you get dirty and the pig seems to like it.

Another developer tries talking to Dave and discovers it's fundamentally
impossible:

His basic response was just that RDF was a joke and the Semantic Web
developers are doing a terrible job.

In the span of less than five minutes Dave makes such an ass of himself that
people at other tables start whispering ""that guy is an idiot...""

The zaphodim, however, are veteran pig wrestlers.  If you've got a similar
tale from the mud pit, be sure to drop us a line at: zaphod@egroups.com.

Aha! Some backing down by the whining one?


It would appear the 'dictator release' strategy that Dave's been trying on
his crappy little set of RSS hacks is failing to gain support.

I'm going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours.
Still have work to do on the sample file, I want to look into the RFC for
time-date specs, and get started on the Radio implementation of 2.0. I have
to prepare for Seybold tomorrow, and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. A
busy few days for a guy still recovering. Also, it would be great if people
who make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any
deal-stoppers.

Hell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use
it!

The poor Radio customers!  The poor Salon blog users!  They're going to be
dragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use!  So
with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their
content into totally unsupported garbage!!!

Ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start
getting rejected!

Of course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card.  What utter
fucking nonsense.  This past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his
'blame America' bullshit.  Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed
with his dictator release of RSS.  Now he's trying to pretend we should be
nice to him because he's still recovering?

Uh, Dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking
fights.  We'll still kick your ass regardless.  That's what years of your
abusing people has gotten you Dave.  No sympathy anymore, none whatsoever.

Dave is Scary on 9/11

Posted on Scripting News on 9/10/2002:


Note: During the day tomorrow there will be no updates to Scripting News.
I'll be in SF at Seybold, leading a discussion on Web Services for
Publishing with people from Amazon, Apple, Google and Jake Savin of
UserLand. I may be able to update my Radio weblog, but only if there's
something really important to report. So best wishes for a happy and safe
9-11.
What kind of asshole wishes people a happy 9/11??!?!?!?!??!! Obviously

If Dave tries to steamroll RSS 2.0 through without formal community

Dave is simply not listening.  People are objecting all over.

Luserland Attempts to Trademark ""RSS""


Dave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any
BigCo that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally
bankrupt. Scripting News is full of examples.

So we found it surprising, as did many others, when Luserland software tried
to patent the term 'RSS' back in 2000. Here's the patent application:

http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78025336

This was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1.0 development
efforts, and the publication of the specification. Winer knew about the RSS
1.0 stuff - indeed, he complained about it bitterly at the time.

Could Dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!!

Since when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others
to do??? A good quote from before he filed the patent application:

Tim O'Reilly says patents are OK, he's just against stupid patents. In the
spirit of Touch of Grey, Tim man, patents are lock-in of the worst kind.
There's no way to route around them.

When's a Permalink not a Permalink?


When Dave writes an item, then removes it!!!!!!!!!!! The permalink links to
nothing at that point. So apparently the ""perma-"" part in permalink is
permanent. For everyone except Dave. Too bad his little attempt at a
definition fails to mention this...!!!!!!!!!

Actually, if I remember correctly from discussion of the list's
composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to
get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say
""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could...

[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,
like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught
you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of
*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get
around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing
transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's
government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of
innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this
summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out
there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]


The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a
""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the
best school possible.

Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,
for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,
ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the
years for proof.

Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after
World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,
Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who
goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually
afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who
couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the
last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,
and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.


The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal""
degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or
learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss
basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after
death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people
who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*
smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.

BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this
rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to
beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You
were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to
Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,
much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on
this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with
educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The
facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.
There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and
economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including
ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,
intelligence and effort.

[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of
competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,
apparently.]



BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,
*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,
all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and
there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,
most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have
*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically
all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and
not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.

That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The
People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better
stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept
apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd
know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase
in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about
extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who
doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some
politician as Santa Claus come election time...


In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not
theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and
redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just
that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.

To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx
wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.

Cheers,
RAH

  | I can't reproduce this error.

For me it is very repeatable... (like every time, without fail).

This is the debug log of the pick happening ...

18:19:03 Pick_It {exec pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace} {4852-4852 -sequence mercury}
18:19:03 exec pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace 4852-4852 -sequence mercury
18:19:04 Ftoc_PickMsgs {{1 hit}}
18:19:04 Marking 1 hits
18:19:04 tkerror: syntax error in expression ""int ...

Note, if I run the pick command by hand ...

delta$ pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace  4852-4852 -sequence mercury
1 hit

That's where the ""1 hit"" comes from (obviously).  The version of nmh I'm
using is ...

delta$ pick -version
pick -- nmh-1.0.4 [compiled on fuchsia.cs.mu.OZ.AU at Sun Mar 17 14:55:56 ICT 2002]

And the relevant part of my .mh_profile ...

delta$ mhparam pick
-seq sel -list


Since the pick command works, the sequence (actually, both of them, the
one that's explicit on the command line, from the search popup, and the
one that comes from .mh_profile) do get created.

kre

ps: this is still using the version of the code form a day ago, I haven't
been able to reach the cvs repository today (local routing issue I think).

Two issues:

--<snip>--
Sorry, but the following packages have unmet dependencies:
  openssh: Depends: openssl (= 0.9.5a) but 0.9.6b-8 is installed
  php-pgsql: Depends: postgresql but it is not installed
             Depends: libpq.so.2
E: Unmet dependencies. Try using -f.
--</snip>--

1. I have the following openssl packages installed:

--<snip>--
openssl-perl-0.9.6b-8
openssl-0.9.6b-8
openssl095a-0.9.5a-11
openssl-devel-0.9.6b-8
--</snip>--

The openssl095a package should provide the openssl-0.9.5a compatibility 
but apt doesn't think so? 

2. I have postgresql installed from the source. So that's why I need 
php-pgsql. Is there a way to tell apt about packages I don't want it to 
complain about?

X-Spam-Level: 

I am somewhat puzzled by a phone call I (or rather the CIO at the ISP for
whom I work) received from an individual claiming to represent Cloudmark.
The gist of the call was that since we were using razor and checking our
mail against the razor servers and that since those servers contain
information proprietary to Cloudmark, we would [in the near future?] be
required to begin paying Cloudmark/spamnet $1.00/user per year. I was
wondering if anyone else has received such a call?

I am curious as to whether a spammer has begun to try contacting razor users
with the above tactic in an effort to get them to stop using razor or
whether the open source/community aspect of the razor project is going by
the wayside in lieu of a strictly commercial approach (ala brightmail and
the likes).

Sven

One of the weirdest things I heard when listening to the Cato Institute debate 
was an economist claim ""a tenet of my profession is that people won't pay for 
something they can get for free."" Someone objected, using the analogy of 
bottled water. There's a far better example: The New York Times.  

Incredibly, this institution puts out pages and pages of high-quality 
professional content each week and then distributes them by means of men in 
trucks across the country overnight where they sit, waiting to be sold to 
people. Meanwhile, the exact same content is available _for free_ using an 
insidious peer-to-peer downloading system called ""the Web"" by typing in the 
keyword ""www.nytimes.com"". Those people at the New York Times must not 
understand the Internet or something! 

More examples: the thriving shareware market, the Baen Free Library, Janis Ian 
and others. 

Other times, people claim that no one will create if they can't get paid. I'd 
like to introduce you to free software and just about every weblog on the 
planet.

Shelley Powers raises[1] some interesting questions re whether RDF has a place 
in syndication. She says that RDF is trying to build a persistent database (aka 
the Semantic Web) and RSS is trying to flow news that has a short lifespan. I 
had not heard this point before. It's worth thinking about.

Robert Harley:
>It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly, 
>precisely identical between males and females.

Yeah, assuming approximately equal populations.
But that obscures the different modes of
promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for
money or power or companionship and the person
who uses money and power and companionship to
get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense
of the word. But their motives and behavior are
quite different.

Langur monkeys were the example in the cited
article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that
are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey
.. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But
cozying up to the current dominant male isn't
the best strategy for female langurs, because
""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every
27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many
extra-group males as possible, female langurs
ensure their offspring against infanticide,""
by the male who is likely next to rule the
roost.

Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a
picture of carefree females engaged in joyously
promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who
is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a
better picture of that. ;-)

Jeremy Zawodny[1] who works at Yahoo Finance offers an RSS 0.91 feed for every 
stock. It's a beta feature. Here's the feed for Microsoft[2] and one for 
Marimba[3]. Thanks to Jon Udell[4] for the pointer. Nice. Jon also notes that 
Microsoft doesn't show up too strong in the weblog world and describes[5] a 
conversation with John Montgomery about this. What a small world. John and I 
got to know each other when we did the work on SOAP in the late 90s, and weblog 
software is one of the major reasons we were interested in SOAP. So close, but 
so far. But it's never too late!

********************************
**Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm)**
********************************

""Personal Choice"" Primo Exotic Supplemental Smoking Botanical / Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" Variety / Supplemental Agenda ""Seventh Heaven"" Paradoxical Configuration for the ""significant"" Enhancement and Pleasuring of body, mind & spirit ""sensitivities"" -- Potentiated; Gnarly, whole-plant Matrix  -- Paragonic Reserve; Enigmatic Blendage Mood ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoking / Brewing Herba.

Actions & indications: Simultaneous, High-Spirited; ""Stimulation / Relaxation / Aphrodisia"" (Significant Paradise Consequence!)

This is the Personal Choice, Sensitive, Responsive Smoking (""Smoka"") product we have wanting to offer! This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again!

We have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater ""Sensitivity / Responsiveness"" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature ""smokables"" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This ""Shangrila"" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass!
 must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves ""potent significance"" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after ""flowering"" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all ""viripotent,"" which makes this ""gnarly stoke"" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve ""viripotency"" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon!
g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.

Suffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, ""sensitive/responsive"", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking (""Smoka"") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!

* Mill-stoned & honed.
* Depressive regressive!
* Psychologically uplifting!
* Good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness!
* Sophisticated, well-balanced ""ambiance.""
* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity.
* ""Potentiated"" & viripotent!
* 4  5 draws lasts a good, goodly while.
* Sweet aphrodisia! (Horny Goat Weed factoring)
* Simultaneously; uplifting and relaxing!
* Easy ignition, Smooth draw, Sweet, heady taste.
* Easy on, easy off!
* SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!
* No ""munchie"" factor.
* No failed drug tests!

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent ""Smoka"", via an herb-pipe. As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of ""Smoka"" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. Smoke and Brew concurrently is absolutely a Sweet, Sensitive Treat!

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated, Mill-Stoned & Honed, exotica botanicals and botanical essences: Half-edged Lily-rare Bian Lian (lobeline factors), Kona Lactuca virosa, Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Hawaiian Vervain (Maui strain), Siberian Leonorus Sibricus, rare Lotus Leaf, Jamaican Blue Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus Crocus Sativa, Chinese (flowering-tops only) Horny Goat Weed, Ginko Biloba, African Cola Vera, and African Wilde Dagga (flowering-tops only). Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does indeed achieve gourmet distinction upon its own merit.

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving. Nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy.

**PROSAKA (tm)**
******************

High-Ratio extracts in tablet form for Calm, Balance, Serenity & Peaceful living.

This Prosaka formulation, which we have just recently further potentiated, boasts an extremely loyal and abundant patronage, having been available to market at large now for a number of years. Prosaka botanical tablets were originally introduced as a botanical, supplemental alternative to various traditional medications that are prescribed for stress, anxiety, depressiveness, mood enhancement, insomnia, excessive dream activity, etc. We like to use this analogy: Imagine the circumstances of your life to be hurricane-ish. Certainly, Prosaka will not stop the wind from blowing. However, it will help to center you within the calm eye of your hurricane, so that you will better see your living and make your decisions from a calmer, more serene, more balanced perspective. Please note that when undertaking any supplemental herbal regimen in this arena, it is important to make a personal commitment to the therapy. It would make no sense to purchase Prosaka and to take it only sporadic!
ally or only briefly. It is for this reason, although Prosaka is a very expensive formulation to produce; that we offer 300 count containers at as much of a reduced price as we are able to offer.

Prosaka is an exclusive, proprietary amalgamation in tablet form which includes the following uncommon botanicals, extracts, flower-top essences and essential oils: Radix Salviae, Sensitive Mimosa Bark, Arillus Euphoriae, Shizandra, Frutcus Mori, Caulis Polygoni, Zizyohus, Tang Kuei, Cedar Seed, Sweetflag Rhizome, Cuscutae, Amber, Radix Scutellariae, Evodia, Longan, Arisaema, Cistanches, Radix Polygalae, Red Sage Root and Eucommia. No factor contained within Prosaka is restricted or regulated by law. All botanicals contained within are non-irradiated and are of pharmaceutical grade. 

Suggested Usage: 1 - 2 tablets; 2 to 3 times per day as needed. Best taken on an empty stomach. (During times of intensity up to 10 tablets per day may be utilized.) 

Also Note: Prosaka is not intended to supercede physician's care nor is it intended for use during pregnancy.

* One 100 count bag ... $55.00 plus shipping
* One 300 count container ... $130.00 plus shipping

**CAPILLARIS HERBA (tm)**
***************************

A Sedate Smoking or Brewing Happiness Botanical.

Capillaris Loose-leaf Herba is a very calming, happy sort of smoking/brewing herba. Capillaris Herba is a singular botanical and is best utilized close to bedtime as it is a very sedate herba. Not as potent as Shangrila Zowie Wowie from a smoking perspective (no legal product is), but well worth your attention! Many folks find that if they partake of both smoke and brew that not only do they go to sleep very happily, but that their dreaming life is often nicely enhanced.

Capillaris Herba botanical is best rolled or bowled when engaged as a ""Smoka."" As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of ""Smoka"" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage Capillaris Herba as a most peaceful brew/tea. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Capillaris Herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) 

Capillaris Herba is not intended for use during work or while driving. Nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy. In addition, although no factor in Capillaris Herba is illegal or regulated, it is the ethical policy of Exotic Botanical Resources that Capillaris Herba not be sold or offered to any person that has not attained at least 21 years of age.

They want to preserve binary compatibility for all .x releases. Red Hat 
8.0 has python 2.2 as default.

Dear Sir / Madam

If you are fed up of being 'ripped off' by the British government every time you buy your tobacco, then you should visit our website, where you can now buy 4 cartons of cigarettes, or 40 pouches of rolling tobacco from as little as 170 Euros (approx 105 pounds), inclusive of delivery by registered air mail from our office in Spain.  

Why pay more???

Visit our website at

WRT the last, it's a small pile of Windows .exe files along with
cygwin1.dll.  The .exes are cmdline programs.  One is a POP3 proxy.  If I
currently have an email server named, say, mail.comcast.net, with user name
timmy, then I change my email reader to say that my server is 127.0.0.1, and
that my user name on that server is mail.comcast.net:timmy.  In that way the
proxy picks up both the real server and user names from what the mail reader
tells it the user name is.

This is an N-way classifier (like ifile that way), and ""all it does"" is
insert a

    X-Text-Classification:  one_of_the_class_names_you_picked

header into your email before passing it on to your mail reader.  The user
then presumably fiddles their mail reader to look for such headers and ""do
something about it"" (and even Outlook can handle *that* much <wink>).

The user is responsible for generating text files with appropriate examples
of each class of message, and for running the cmdline tools to train the
classifier.

And it is pretty common practice in some environments with public 
workstations to just wipe and re-install Windows machines on a weekly 
(or even daily) basis. It's easier than trying to maintain Windows.

Well, you could damn well get a fucking better attitude.
I practically handed you a job the other week and you

Hello fork,

  So they have Aaron Schwartz on NPR's Weekend Edition talking
  about Warchalking.   I'll agree, its funny, his voice is squeaky and
  I'm jealous that he got on radio and I didn't...

  But really, WTF is the big deal about warchalking?  I have yet to
  see any of it, anywhere.

  LInk will probably pop up on www.npr.org later today.

In my experience, they do care.  It has to work certainly, and in
particular it has to work with what they've already got, and it has to
work on client's systems.

My limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on
Linux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven't come back yet.

Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.
They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a
service pack.  Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to
run C programs.

Can't say I spend any noticeable amount of time on memory management

If your problem just requires application of a ""design pattern"" to solve,
then it's trivial anyway irrespective of language.

You appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time
on irrelevant low-level problems and Java programmers don't.  Depends
entirely on the programmer, not the language.

Buzzword.

Unsupported assertion.

Dunno.  E.g., I ported a wee 15000-line C program to Darwin on PowerPC
in a few minutes yesterday.  Sure if it was badly designed it would be
10 times the size and harder to port.  If it depended on unavailable
libraries it would be much harder.  Portable code is easy to port.
At least that is the case when then language you used is available on
the target platform: I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java.

You can pay a good programmer to solve your problem now, or else get
some kids to hack spaghetti Fortran in any language and then pay for
maintenance headaches ad infinitum.

Whoah!!!  Performance matters to me every day.  (Right now I'm taking
time out to write email while waiting for a job to run).  Sure I could
wait 5 years until everyone's PC is fast enough to generate random EC's
in no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code
that is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors,
or I can do it now when very few people can.

Yes.

It's true!  I admit everything!  Mea maxima culpa!  Working in C makes
me spend all day thinking base, rank thoughts about hard-core bitography!
Not.

Actually I spend most of my time thinking in high-level mathematics.


>Why do most computer scientists insist on solving the same problems
>over and over again [...]

Dunno, and frankly I don't see the relevance to the issue at hand.


I'm sure Java is fine for some stuff, as is C or whatever.  Horses for
courses.

Hi

I've just installed SpamAssassin and relevant modules.
Just tried the initial test: 

spamassassin -t < sample-nonspam.txt > nonspam.out

and got back:

Broken Pipe

I've also tried using the -P and --pipe option but to
no avail.

Any help greatly appreciated. BTW - I'm no great Perl
expert!

Peter

The Distributed.net project -- a precursor to SETI@Home that used volunteer 
computer-time to attack giant, sophisticated ciphers -- has cracked RC564. I 
used to have half a dozen computers working on this. 

    On 14-Jul-2002, a relatively characterless PIII-450 in Tokyo returned the 
    winning key to the distributed.net keyservers. The key 0x63DE7DC154F4D039 
    produces the plaintext output: 

    The unknown message is: some things are better left unread 

    Unfortunately, due to breakage in scripts (dbaker's fault, naturally) on 
    the keymaster, this successful submission was not automatically detected. 
    It sat undiscovered until 12-Aug-2002. The key was immediately submitted to 
    RSA Labs and was verified as the winning key.

Easter Egg has been discovered in the transmission control software for the BMW 
M3: 

    ...the proper combination of commands to the electronically controlled 
    manual transmission will cause the car to rev up to 4000rpm and drop the 
    clutch... 

Are we sure that this is a feature and not a bug? Link[1] Discuss[2]

Opening arguments are set to begin early next month in Eldred vs. Ashcroft,
a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that will decide the future of copyright
law, including how and when artists and writers can build upon the work of
others.

....

To heighten public awareness of the importance of the case an Internet
bookmobile is set to depart San Francisco next Monday on a trip that will
bring it to the steps of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.,
before arguments wrap up. The van, which will be stopping at schools,
libraries and senior centers along the way, is equipped to provide free
high-speed access to thousands of literary and artistic works that are
already in the public domain.

--------

I had the opportunity to visit the Internet Archive about a month ago, and
saw the bookmobile under construction. It's a neat idea. Take an SUV, put a
small satellite dish on the top, and put a computer, printer, and binding
machine in the back. Voila -- people can search for a book, then print out a
copy right there on the spot. Quite literally on-demand printing. Total
fixed cost of the computer/printer/binding machine, if bought new (the IA
had the equipment donated) is under $10k.

One of the goals is to show libraries across the country that they could, if
they wished, add these ""virtual holdings"" (public domain materials) to their
existing library, at a fixed cost most libraries can afford. This should be
compelling to small libraries in remote areas.

Using the score-ranges stuff and my aggressive anti-FP evaluation code,
BTW, yielded an average FP of 5.7 points, with 0.67% FPs and 96.57%
overall accuracy -- but I notice you went back to the other method.
Just pointing this out ;)

Here are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes, with 
no reference to sexual preference that I could find. The point would seem to 
be that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve, with a few people, a la 
Wilt Chamberlain, having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts, 
ev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more 
partners than women.  I have no idea, being a statistical ignoramus, whether 
the fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely 
promiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you'd get 
even more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other 
men. 


http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Sex_partners/Content_sex.html

<<For example, the mean number of partners since sexual initiation for women 
is approximately 7 and in a sample of less than 1500 Swedish women we find an 
individual with 100 partners. For men, the mean is approximately 15 and we 
find an individual with 800 partners, which is almost 50 times larger than 
the mean! So, somehow Don Juan was not such an extraordinary case but just 
one data point in a wide spectrum of behaviors that can be observed. >>


As for gay men: There is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme 
promiscuity among gay men. You can read about it in Randy Schiltz's And the 
Band Played On. He writes about  bathhouse culture pre-HIV; he also discusses 
how, in the gay politics of the time, there was a sub-culture of what you 
might call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having 
many partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. It was an 
explicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture.
    That view seems to have died, in more ways than one. Part of the point of 
Schiltz's book was to condemn the role that it and  bathhouse culture played 
in spreading the AIDs epidemic that eventually killed Schiltz, among so many 
others. This doesn't let Eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that 
there was a  cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community.

IM client vulnerable to attack 
IM client vulnerable to attack 

James Pearce, ZDNet Australia  

Users of messenger client Trillian are vulnerable to attack, according to
information security analyst John Hennessy.

Hennessy has published a proof-of-concept showing the latest version of
Trillian, v0.73, is vulnerable to a buffer-overflow attack that will
allow individuals with malicious intent to run any program on the
computer.

Trillion is a piece of software that allows you to connect to ICQ, AOL
Instant Messenger, MSN Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger and IRC with a single
interface, despite some companies actively avoiding messenger
interoperability.

According to Jason Ross, senior analyst at amr interactive, in June 2002
there were 28,000 home users of Trillian in Australia, about 0.4 percent
of the Internet population, and 55,000 people using it at work, about 1.8
percent of the Internet population.

David Banes, regional manager of Symantec security response, told ZDNet
Australia the code appeared to be valid.

""With these sort of things you have to find some process that would
accept a connection, then throw loads of random data at it and get it to
crash,"" he said. ""Once it's crashed, you can try to find a way to exploit
it.""

He said the proof-of-concept that was published is designed to run on
Notepad, but could be easily modified to run any program on the system.
He said the problem was easy to fix by ""writing protective code around
that particular piece to more closely validate the data around that
piece.""

""Because people are pushed for productivity you tend to leave out the
checks and balances you should put in, which is why we have all these
buffer overflows and exploits out there now,"" said Banes.

Cerulean Studios, creator of Trillian, was contacted for comment but had
not responded by the time of publication.

All the world loves a smartass...

:-).

Seriously. Look at he life expectancy and human carrying capacity of
this continent before the Europeans got here. Look at it now. Even
for descendants of the original inhabitants. Even for the descendents
of slaves, who were brought here by force.

More stuff, cheaper. That's progress.

Poverty, of course, is not relative. It's absolute. Disparity in
wealth has nothing to do with it.

It's like saying that groups have rights, when, in truth, only
individuals do. Like group rights, ""disparity"" in wealth is
statistical sophistry.


Besides, even if you can't help the distribution, industrial wealth
is almost always transitory, and so is relative poverty, even when
there are no confiscatory death-taxes. The 20th anniversary Forbes
400 just came out, and only a few tens of people are still there
since 1982, a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes on
wealth, income, and inheritance than we do now. More to the point,
they're nowhere near the top.

I'll take those odds. It is only when neofeudalism reasserts itself,
in the form of government regulation, confiscatory taxes, legislated
monopoly, corporate welfare, ""non-profit"" neoaristocratic tax dodges,
and legalized labor extortion that we get slowdowns in progress, like
what happened in Fabian-era Britain, or 1970's USA.

In fact, it is in countries where wealth is the most ""unfairly""
distributed, that you get the most improvement in the general --
economic -- welfare. More stuff cheaper, fewer people dying, more
people living longer.

I'll take those odds as well. People take greater risks when the
returns are higher, improving the lot of us all as a result.

Cheers,
RAH

I knew it'd be a day for insanity.

so anyway, news.com decided to write up two wonderful articles on the
DMCA and decided to link to decss.exe, the very verboten code that
ended up getting 2600 (but none of the other news services that
originally linked) spanked.

Slashdot, of course, links to them.

So now, I link to slashdot.

http://slashdot.org/articles/02/10/07/1331217.shtml?tid=123

I find this all incredibly funny really.  Congress _and_ the courts
relaly do need to be considering how laws such as the DMCA are
applied.  For the most part, these rules are coming down to whose
friend you happen to be, how nefarious the defendant party is, and how
asleep the judge is behind the case (asleep/self-interested/bought).
Its giving me a real cynical view on being a lawyer, thats for sure.

I reran the experiment (with the new SpamHam1.pik, but it doesn't seem
to make a difference).  Here are the clues for the two spams in my
inbox (in hammie.py's output format, which sorts the clues by
probability; the first two numbers are the message number and overall
probability; then line-folded):

    66 1.00 S 'facility': 0.01; 'speaker': 0.01; 'stretch': 0.01;
    'thursday': 0.01; 'young,': 0.01; 'mistakes': 0.12; 'growth':
    0.85; '>content-type:text/plain': 0.85; 'please': 0.85; 'capital':
    0.92; 'series': 0.92; 'subject:Don': 0.94; 'companies': 0.96;
    '>content-type:text/html': 0.96; 'fee': 0.96; 'money': 0.96;
    '8:00am': 0.99; '9:00am': 0.99; '>content-type:image/gif': 0.99;
    '>content-type:multipart/alternative': 0.99; 'attend': 0.99;

    0.99; 'content-type:multipart/related': 0.99; 'economy': 0.99;
    'economy""': 0.99

This has 6 content-types as spam clues, only one of which is related
to HTML, despite there being an HTML alternative (and 12 other spam
clues, vs. only 6 ham clues).  This was an announcement of a public
event by our building owners, with a text part that was the same as
the HTML (AFAICT).  Its language may be spammish, but the content-type
clues didn't help.  (BTW, it makes me wonder about the wisdom of
keeping punctuation -- 'economy' and 'economy""' to me don't seem to
deserve two be counted as clues.)

I've been looking into hotels.  I poked around expedia for availability
from March 26 to 29 (4 nights, wednesday thorugh saturday).  

I've also started contacting hotels for group rates; some of the group
rates are no better than the regular rates, and they require signing a
contract with a minimum number of rooms sold (with someone financially
responsible for unbooked rooms).  Most hotels are less than responsive...

	Radission - Barcelo Hotel (DuPont Circle)
	$125/night, $99/weekend

	State Plaza hotel (Foggy Bottom; near GWU)
	$119/night, $99/weekend

	Hilton Silver Spring (Near Metro, in suburban MD)
	$99/hight, $74/weekend

	Windsor Park Hotel
	Conn Ave, between DuPont Circle/Woodley Park Metro stations
	$95/night; needs a car

	Econo Lodge Alexandria (Near Metro, in suburban VA)
	$95/night

This is a hand picked list; I ignored anything over $125/night, even
though there are some really well situated hotels nearby at higher rates.
Also, I'm not sure how much these prices reflect an expedia-only
discount.  I can't vouch for any of these hotels, either.

I also found out that the down season for DC Hotels are mid-june through
mid-september, and mid-november through mid-january.

""""""

This one has no MIME structure nor HTML!  It even has a
Content-disposition which is counted as a non-spam clue.  It got
f-p'ed because of the many hospitality-related and money-related
terms.  I'm surprised $125/night and similar aren't clues too.  (And
again, several spam clues are duplicated with different variations:
'hotel', 'hotels', 'hotels.', 'subject:Hotel', 'rates,', 'rates.'.

I also looked in more detail at some f-p's in my geeks traffic.  The
first one's a doozie (that's the term, right? :-).  It has lots of
HTML clues that are apparently ignored.  It was a multipart/mixed with
two parts: a brief text/plain part containing one or two sentences, a
mondo weird URL:

http://x60.deja.com/[ST_rn=ps]/getdoc.xp?AN=687715863&CONTEXT=973121507.1408827441&hitnum=23

and some employer-generated spammish boilerplate; the second part was
the HTML taken directly from the above URL.  Clues:

The second f-p had the same structure (and sender :-); the third f-p
had the same structure and a different sender.  Ditto the fifth, sixth.  (Not posting clues for
brevity.)

The fourth was different: plaintext with one very short sentence and a
URL.  Clues:

   300 1.00 S 'from:email addr:digicool': 0.01; 'http1:news': 0.24;
   'from:email addr:com>': 0.32; 'from:tres': 0.50; 'http>1:1114digi':

   0.99; 'http>1:local': 0.99; 'subject:firm': 0.99; 'us:': 0.99

The seventh was similar.

I scanned a bunch more until I got bored, and most of them were either
of the first form (brief text with URL followed by quoted HTML from
website) or the second (brief text with one or more URLs).

It's up to you to decide what to call this, but I think these are none
of your #1, #2 or #3 (they're close to #3, but all are multipart/mixed
rather than multipart/alternative).

It's possible that the corpus you've trained on is more homogeneous
than you thought.

The overclockers have given it another jolt, perhaps to potential sales 
(and maybe sales of liquid nitrogen):

*Tekijä:* Sampsa Kurri <mailto:sampsa.kurri@muropaketti.com>




*English Summary*

When the Intel Pentium 4 2,8GHz CPU arrived to our testlab we ordered 10 
liters of Liquid Nitrogen (LN2 -196°C) and decided to run some tests in 
very low temperatures.

After some adjusting and testing we were able to run SiSoft Sandra CPU 
and Memory benchmarks and Pifast benchmark smoothly when the CPU was 
running at 3917MHz. We raised the FSB one more step and managed to run 
succesfully SuperPi benchmark while CPU was running at 3998MHz. The 
result was 39 seconds.

Test setup: P4 2,8GHz, Modified Asus P4T533-C, Samsung PC800 RDRAM, PNY 
GeForce 4 MX440 and Windows XP OS.

Check out the pictures.

Looks like Google did a deal to index the NY Times. If you do this news search
[1], and mouse over the link, you'll see there's a partner attribute on the 
URL, like the ones in our links[2]. What are the implications of this? Here's 
one. Martin Nisenholtz may now have a _chance_ of winning his bet[3] with me.

LAGOS - NIGERIA.


YOUR KIND ATTN.,



RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.

I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this
mail, if the contents does not meet with your personal
and business ethics, I apologize in advance.

I am Barrister Kola Owolabi( attorney at law), I
represent Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzoâs estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief
security advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the
person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the
advent of a new democratic
dispensation in the country under the leadership of
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under
severe persecution due to the sensitive position he
held in the last military regime, presently he is
under house arrest restricted only to the confines of
his village.

The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a
business proposal that might be of interest to you. My
client has informed me of the existence of funds
deposited with a security company abroad. This fund
came about as part of security votes that were
allocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure
as chief security adviser to the then president. What
happened was that he had part of the funds transferred
from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this
security outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal
security outfit of the
then president. But before the purchase could take
place the president died. My client has decided to
keep this for himself as all his properties has been
confisticated by the present regime. But due to his
incarceration he cannot travel out and effect the
change of possession to his benefit.

I have been mandated by my client to source for a
foreign partner that can help him facilitate the
change of possession. The deposit certificate and the
code needed for the execution of this endeavor are in
my possession.

The funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred Thousand
United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you, you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor.

I remain most obliged.

Barrister Kola Owolabi(JP).
Principal Partner. Owolabi & Associates

This step is unneccesary -- unless you've changed the scripts 
much, any test in the logs which aren't in the rules files will 
just be ignored I think.  You do seem to have changed the 
logs-to-c script and removed the bit where you could specify 
immutable tests at the top -- I took a brief glance through the 
code and couldn't fully make out how it had changed.  I think we 
want to be able to specify immutable test scores though in there 
somewhere -- or is that now handled by the tflags stuff?  For 
the last couple releases, any test which occurred infrequently 
(by thumb-in-the-wind subjective criteria) I set to have 
immutable scores, as well as a handful of other rules.

Shouldn't be a problem.  Assuming I can get the darned thing to 
compile :)

Thanks Matthias.  Actually I got all four speakers with subwoofer
working in digital out mode with gamixer.
(http://www1.tcnet.ne.jp/fmurata/linux/down/)

However switching between analog and digital, I'm still baffled.  As I
have a tuner and cassette deck hooked up to ""Line In"" on a SBLive! 5.1,
which is in analog mode.  But digital out works great now!

If anyone here is running (null) beta then you may like these Gnome theme packages.
They are enhanced and repackages from my previous theme packs, this time to conform
to the way pre-release RH8 handles themes for GTK1 and GTK2.

RedHat has a preferences -> themes app, but themes only show up there that have BOTH
gtk1.2 (Gnome1) themes AND gtk1.4 (GTK2 aka Gnome2) themes available. Then RH will
apply the theme to both GTK versions, so the user does not really notice that
different GTK toolkit versions are being used, since they *should* look the same.

This ""gtk2-engines-compat"" RPM has GTK2 ported themes for those themes that are
included in the RH package ""gtk-engines"" themes pack for GTK1.

The ""gtk1+2-themez"" pack mostly repackages my previous theme RPMs in a way that the
(null) btea like, and supposedly the next RH8 when released :)

I make these for myself, you may find them of interest. See the .spec file(s) for info.

http://www.dudex.net/rpms/gtk2-engines-compat-1.0-aap1.noarch.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/gtk2-engines-compat-1.0.spec

http://www.dudex.net/rpms/gtk1+2-themez-1.1-aap1.noarch.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/gtk1+2-themez-1.1.spec

You'll need gtk-engines, gtk2-engines, and a ""thinice"" engine for gtk2, this one
might be a old now but it works:

http://www.dudex.net/rpms/gtk2-thinice-engine-2.0.1-2.i386.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/gtk2-thinice-engine-2.0.1-2.src.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/gtk2-thinice-engine-2.0.1.spec

--
That's ""angle"" as in geometry.

Vernon,

I'm changing the instructions in the SpamAssassin INSTALL file 
right now to:

tar xfvz dcc-dccproc.tar.Z
cd dcc-dccproc-X.X.X
./configure && make && make install
cdcc 'info'


Let me know ASAP if that's innapropriate, since we're shipping 
2.40 today!

Dear Garrison,

There are at least six plans about what to do with
""Ground Zero"" in New York. I believe a suitable memorial
surrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways,
children's playgrounds, possibly some concessions such
as a restaurant, small theater and a place for art works
would be the best tribute to those who lost their lives.
What do you think should done with the space?

Joe Adams
Hillsdale, New Jersey

I dread the thought of a big memorial in Manhattan
that's designed by committee and that's gone through
public hearings and so forth ----- it's going to be cold
and ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one more
public space that the public hates, of which there are
plenty already. New York is a bustling commercial city
and that's the beauty of it, it's a city of young
ambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in the
towers, and it's not a memorializing city. Historic
events occurred in New York that in any other city would
be commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and
historical museums and in New York there's barely a
little plaque. That's a great thing, in my estimation.
It's a hustling city, full of immigrants looking for
their big chance, and compared to that spirit of
entrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and a
statue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant's
Tomb. Who walks past it and thinks about President
Grant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant's Tomb
and think about lunch, about sex, about money, about all
the things that New York is about. If you want to find
Grant, read his memoirs. His monument seems odd in New
York: it belongs in Washington, which is our memorial
city. New York is for the young and lively.

Not fortean, but a moment in time all the same...

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2220972.stm


Betamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after
losing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. 
Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000
more machines for the Japanese market. 

They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998. 

 
VHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s
 
Betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better
quality than its VHS rival. 

Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,
1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the
film rental industry and in homes. 

Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. 

""With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the
market, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to
secure parts,"" Sony said in a statement. 

Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the
format. 

The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the
television and film industries and will be unaffected. 

But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin
for Betamax home players. 

In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. 

Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of
competition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. 

The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,
although VHS tapes had a longer duration. 

A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no
new ones will be made after the end of 2002. 

Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.

My paltry 3000-message training set makes a 6.3MB (where 1MB=1e6 bytes)
pickle.  hammie.py, which I just checked in, will optionally let you
write stuff out to a dbm file.  With that same message base, the dbm
file weighs in at a hefty 21.4MB.  It also takes longer to write:

  Using a database:
   real    8m24.741s
   user    6m19.410s
   sys     1m33.650s

  Using a pickle:
   real    1m39.824s
   user    1m36.400s
   sys     0m2.160s

This is on a PIII at 551.257MHz (I don't know what it's *supposed* to
be, 551.257 is what /proc/cpuinfo says).

For comparison, SpamOracle (currently the gold standard in my mind, at
least for speed) on the same data blazes along:

   real    0m29.592s
   user    0m28.050s
   sys     0m1.180s

Its data file, which appears to be a marshalled hash, is 448KB.
However, it's compiled O'Caml and it uses a much simpler tokenizing
algorithm written with a lexical analyzer (ocamllex), so we'll never be
able to outperform it.  It's something to keep in mind, though.

I don't have statistics yet for scanning unknown messages.  (Actually, I
do, and the database blows the pickle out of the water, but it scores
every word with 0.00, so I'm not sure that's a fair test. ;)  In any
case, 21MB per user is probably too large, and 10MB is questionable.  

On the other hand, my pickle compressed very well with gzip, shrinking
down to 1.8MB.

You are not still using sourceforge, are you? If you have any hopes that they 
are anything but yet another business giving away a free service, then see

you look to have 2 versions of spamd installed.  The one running from
the RC script is pre-2.4 (there is a -H now, and -F has been removed),
but the one you run from the commandline seems to be a 2.4x version.

I would find that old version of SA and blow it away.

Dear gawd - 'lost its reputation' - how horrible for those Northern

Oh, they were plenty upset about the tea taxes.

But the crack down on colonial script certainly screwed over the
American Colonies.  And, BTW, England as well.

Dear Ben Franklin was right for the wrong reasons.  First of all the
colonies were not prosperous compared to England proper.  Second, the
issuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement.

(In fact, it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim.  It
sounds like a modern Keynsian was creating an urban legend.)

OTOH the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments was
economically crippling.  Imagine trying to buy your supplies by offering
IOUs on your own name -- and then trying to market / exchange the paper
as the merchant who took the IOU.

===========================

The most common problem in the world is when a government prints too
much money.  The effects are a complete disaster.  There are a lot of
incentives that push governments into doing this even though it is
incredibly stupid.

So almost all the literature talks about that.

But you can ALSO screw an economy over by taking all the money out of
circulation.  The fundamental cause of the American Great Depression was
exactly this, courtesy of the Federal Reserve Board.

I don't think shifting the power to print money to the bank of Canada
had much effect.  And Canada is still a prosperous country.

Sony makes such a line of products.

My father was legendary for his abilty to break things.  His 'thumbs of death'
would rival anything a toddler could do to devices.  After countless numbers of
Walkman devices having their lids broken or buttons pressed into oblivion I
found the Sony devices.  I got him a ""My First Sony"" (be afraid of the
marketing) CD player.   It was /fire engine red/ but was completely
indestructible.  I hacked a headphone jack into it and gave it to him.  He
complained of it's looks but used it nonetheless.  I also gave him a pack of
headphones as there's no such things indestuctible headphones that aren't
obscenely bulky.

Now that we're riding up the curve of an ever increasing geezer population, how
soon before device makers get wise?  Not to be morbid, but would the marketing
be ""My Last Sony""?  <ducks and runs>

Because ~10 krpm server SCSII doesn't follow the curve. Most rackspace is
ridiculously expensive/unit, so people don't use low end EIDE hardware 
there.

Folks,

     There have been several major internet outages this morning,
     across major providers UUNet, Genuity, and god knows who else.
     Various routes across the Internet backbones have been
     disappearing, repropagating, and disappearing again.

     This has caused and exacerbated several problems which we are
     working on correcting right now.  We apologize for the
     inconvenience..

Best,=20

Man admits Soham kidnapping hoax calls

A man has admitted making hoax calls to police investigating the
disappearance of Soham schoolgirls Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells.
Wrexham Magistrates Court, in North Wales, heard jobless Howard Youde made
three calls to police in Cambridgeshire claiming to have abducted the
youngsters.
He was arrested in Wrexham in the early hours of August 16 when officers
traced the call to a phone box on the town's Brook Street.
The 45-year-old, of Queensway, Hope, near Wrexham, has pleaded guilty to one
count of wasting police time on August 15 this year.
The court was told Youde claimed to have no recollection of making the calls
having been drinking all day.
Defence lawyer Mark Arden says the offence was neither premeditated nor
calculated but added that this was no excuse.
He said: ""What he's done is horrific. It's unforgivable. The distress he's
caused the families is unacceptable.""
Youde has been released on unconditional bail until November 7 when he will
be sentenced.
The hearing has been adjourned for pre-sentence reports although the
defendant has been warned custody is an option.

September 11, 2002 8:00 a.m.
The Wages of September 11
There is no going back.



September 11 changed our world. Those who deny such a watershed event take a
superficially short-term view, and seem to think all is as before simply
because the sun still rises and sets.

This is a colossal misjudgment. The collapse of the towers, the crashing
into the Pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 Americans  all seen live in real
time by millions the world over  tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds,
which, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. The killers
dealt in icons  the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting the
manifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power, and
centering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world. Yes,
they got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killing
has instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine.

Islamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morally
repugnant  and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades. By
lurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, the
vampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and
bombs; but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove only
ghoulish not fearsome.

The more the world knows of al Qaeda and bin Laden, the more it has found
them both vile and yet banal  and so is confident and eager to eradicate
them and all they stand for. It is one thing to kill innocents, quite
another to take on the armed might of an aroused United States. Easily
dodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of Afghanistan may make good
theater and bring about braggadocio; dealing with grim American and British
commandos who have come 7,000 miles for your head prompts abject flight and
an occasional cheap infomercial on the run. And the ultimate consequence of
the attacks of September 11 will not merely be the destruction of al Qaeda,
but also the complete repudiation of the Taliban, the Iranian mullocracy,
the plague of the Pakistani madrassas, and any other would-be fundamentalist
paradise on earth.

Foreign relations will not be the same in our generation. Our coalition with
Europe, we learn, was not a partnership, but more mere alphabetic
nomenclature and the mutual back scratching of Euro-American globetrotters 
a paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the Cold
War. The truth is that Europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade has
insidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an
antidemocratic EU, a 80,000-person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power
is as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often
dubious international accords. This sad realization September 11 brutally
exposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the
moment completely lost its moral bearings. Indeed, as the months progressed
the problems inherent in ""the European way"" became all too apparent:
pretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstract
moralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, and
constant American ankle-biting even as Europe lives in a make-believe Shire
while we keep back the forces of Mordor from its picturesque borders, with
only a few brave Frodos and Bilbos tagging along. Nothing has proved more
sobering to Americans than the skepticism of these blinkered European
hobbits after September 11.

America learned that ""moderate"" Arab countries are as dangerous as hostile
Islamic nations. After September 11, being a Saudi, Egyptian, or Kuwaiti
means nothing special to an American  at least not proof of being any more
friendly or hostile than having Libyan, Syrian, or Lebanese citizenship.
Indeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of
their anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases  like NATO  belongs to a
pre-9/11 age of Soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. Now we learn
that broadcasting state-sponsored hatred of Israel and the United States is
just as deadly to our interests as scud missiles  and as likely to come
from friends as enemies. Worst-case scenarios like Iran and Afghanistan
offer more long-term hope than ""stable regimes"" like the Saudis; governments
that hate us have populations that like us  and vice versa; the Saudi royal
family, whom 5,000 American troops protect, and the Mubarak autocracy, which
has snagged billions of American dollars, are as afraid of democratic
reformers as they are Islamic fundamentalists. And with good reason: Islamic
governments in Iran and under the Taliban were as hated by the masses as
Arab secular reformers in exile in the West are praised and championed.

The post-9/11 domestic calculus is just as confusing. Generals and the
military brass call civilians who seek the liberation of Iraq ""chicken
hawks"" and worse. Yet such traditional Vietnam-era invective I think rings
hollow after September 11, and sounds more like McClellan's shrillness
against his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery
ended than resonant of Patton's audacity in charging after murderous Nazis.
More Americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those
soldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of Vietnam nearly 30
years ago. Indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of
Vietnam are now in or nearing retirement; and, thank God, there is no
generation of Americans in the present military  other than a few thousand
brave veterans of the Gulf, Mogadishu, and Panama  who have been in
sustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. Because American
soldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security
is lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in
lower Manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at the
Pentagon or CIA than be at sea on a sub or destroyer.

Real concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than
rejecting force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad
as our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at
home. It seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into
harm's way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect
thousands in high-rises.

Politics have been turned upside down. In the old days, cynical
conservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes
repellent Realpolitik. In the age of Russian expansionism, they were loathe
to champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist Trojan Horse whose
belly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. Thus they were
so often at loggerheads with naïve and idealist leftists.

No longer. The end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive Soviet
Communism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. Champions
of freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise
open economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the Russians. Instead,
even reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in
the Middle East than are dour and skeptical leftists. The latter, if
multiculturalists, often believe that democracy is a value-neutral Western
construct, not necessarily a universal good; if pacifists, they claim
nonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. The Right, not the
Left, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, and
idealism  with obvious domestic ramifications for any Republican president
astute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support.

All this and more are the wages of the disaster of September 11 and the
subsequent terrible year  and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, we
will see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.

We have a partnership with Webex.  We use their serivce
for cross-firewall app sharing--something that Netmeeting/Messenger
and Sametime require a lot of configuration of firewalls,
authentications, access controls and user training for.  

Now Webex has invites, instant meeting launch without any

in between Web conferences and places to store and author

  Tadpole's Secure Web Software Subsidiary Endeavors Technology Teams With Web
  Meetings Leader WebEx Communications
  To Provide Best-of-Breed Solution For Extended Group Collaboration During
  and Between Online Meetings

  Web meetings raise the quality of team interaction and communications for
  users of the Web's secure, P2P collaboration network

  ###

  Tadpole Technology plc, the mobile computing and network infrastructure
  group, today announces that its web collaboration subsidiary, Endeavors
  Technology, Inc., has teamed with Web meetings leader, WebEx
  Communications,Inc. to help professionals make better use of corporate time
  and resources, and gain competitive advantage. By integrating the advanced
  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure P2P
  collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class
  teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.

  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this
  world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around
  the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience
  between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how
  to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between
  meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple
  copies of constantly changing documents.

  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of
  time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit
  information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than
  having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured
  environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also
  essential.

  Endeavors' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for
  sharing information directly from people's desktops. WebEx meetings can be
  recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be
  actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules
  can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at
  will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,
  inside or outside company firewalls.

  Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web
  meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at
  will, but they can also know which other participants are online or
  ""present."" This enables them to chat and message each other, search across
  other people's Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents
  highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx
  conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,
  and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.

  ""In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed
  services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries,"" says
  Bernard Hulme, Tadpole's group chief executive. ""The powerful combination
  of Endeavors' Magi and WebEx's communications technologies will assist
  global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by
  maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings.""

  ""WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing,
  training, support and product design,"" says David Farrington, vice president
  of corporate development at WebEx Communications. ""By integrating the
  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure
  collaboration network, Endeavors has created an offering that provides the
  best in synchronous and asynchronous communications.""

Actually, 5.6. I clocked my &#8220;long loop&#8221; today and discovered that 
the run I thought was 6 miles is actually only 5.6. And the &#8220;short 
loop&#8221; I thought was 5 miles is actually only 4.6. I have an off-by-0.4 
bug. This is very upsetting. I've lost 0.4 miles somewhere. If anyone finds 
them, can you please let me know? Thank you. 

I ran 9 miles last week, and 10 so far this week, even taking into account my 
off-by-0.4 bug. I fear I am turning into a runner. My father and I made fun of 
runners when I was growing up. He used to say that you never saw a runner 
smiling. We'd drive by runners, point at them, and say, &#8220;Look, another 
runner... not smiling!&#8221; This weighed heavily on my psyche in my formative 
years. So it is with some measure of shame that I admit that I am becoming a 
runner. 

Becoming a runner is actually not that difficult. Not surprisingly, it involves 
running. There's other stuff, too, eventually, but running is the important 
part. If you can run a mile, run a mile. If you can only run around the block, 
run around the block. Tomorrow you'll run around the block, and the next day 
you'll find you can run around two blocks. And next week you'll find you can 
run a mile. Then one day you'll run a mile, then stop to catch your breath, 
then get invigorated and run another mile. 

And then you're a runner. That's it, really. It's not complicated. You run, and 
you run, and you run. And one day, you discover that shoes are important, and 
that the old sneakers you threw on the first time you tried out this running 
thing out aren't actually very good for running. So you go buy new shoes, and 
you run, and you run, and you run. And later, you discover that stretching is 
important too, so you stretch and run, and stretch and run, and stretch and 
run. 

There's other stuff too, but it doesn't really matter until you're already a 
runner. You learn about differences in running surfaces. And how many miles you 
should really put on one pair of shoes. And when in the day you should run to 
maximize calorie burning. And how to train for a marathon, and so forth. Don't 
worry about any of that now. Just run. Running is key. Otherwise you're just 
another fat schmuck lying on the couch reading _Runner's World_.

Ahm, if you don't object to using a mouse for such things, exmh has 
the ability to insert different sigs on demand.  Create a bunch of 
different sig files, all beginning with .signature, and at start up, 
exmh will load them all.  In the Sedit window, you'll see a Sign...
menu item which will allow you to select between each of the listed 
.signature files for *that* e-mail.  You can actually use several if 
you'd like (though I don't remember what Preferences... option allows 
for this).

However, the signature gets added on send, not inserted directly into 
the existing Sedit window prior to composition.

I currently have 6 different sig files I can choose between.

Additionally, if a .signature file has the execute bit turned on, 
exmh will attempt to execute the file and use the stdout of the 
script as your signature.

I hope this helps some.

I did something crudely along those lines for VMS VAX maybe 13 years
ago; there is at least one product that does it for PC though I don't
recall its name. It is also handy for cases where you have a CD image
of some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that is
intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or is
not graceful) readonly storage. It is also more or less necessary
if you want to work with WORM file structures, which are older still.
There have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the
early 1980s if not before.

A generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement
snapshots on top of an existing filesystem. The written information
must (obviously!) be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you
wrote to the storage. A device level implementation is however perfectly
adequate.

It does not, of course, distinguish for you what should have been changed
and what should not. If you truly know a device (or perhaps a partition)
must not be written, it can be simpler to either return error on writes,
or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data. (NTFS
lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments. I have not
tried it on extf3 or reiser.) 

BTW, think about your mention of RAID and consider the complexity of
writing to RAID4 or RAID5...
I would contend that with cheaper storage these days, it makes little sense
to use RAID, save for shadowing and possibly striping. Those at least do
not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher RAID levels have, and
there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk
may hold 200 gigs and up. Why not dedicate another whole disk to fault
recovery
and lose the complexity and slow write (sometimes) of RAID?

Subject: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from
attacks


Hi,

I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a
base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base
image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes
changes to its own ""redo"" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance
incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the
current disk image for that specific virtual machine.

This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the
honeypots mailing list)
http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html

Could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server
applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,
even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.

The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are
layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server
running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net
business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one
of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database
server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one
partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the
partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from
one boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap
space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.

When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that
shouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or
Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But
what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or
""redo"" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the
redo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be
minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from
backup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high
availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is
always accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at
the same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater
performance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be
applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions
(except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)

Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept
been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know?
I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in
this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server
systems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and
non-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly
ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or
no) downtime.

Thanks for any opinions,
Ben

Rob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger and others Cliff Skolnik at the O'Reilly OS X con 
has tracked down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network 
here -- every 20 or 30 seconds, you start getting ""connection refused"" messages 
from your browser and other net-utilities. Rob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger wrote 
it up. 

It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other 
""promiscuous"" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same 
time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your 
segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a ""rejected"" message. 

So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around 
and tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa). 
Ah, fickle networking, you are such a stern mistress! Link[2] Discuss[3] (_
Thanks, Rob!_)

I have translated the article in full - see 
end of post (I think that I've done a far 
better job than the Google translation - at 
least it's readable now - any corrections
appreciated).

Stuff in {}'s is my (and others) additions 
to the debate.

My apologies if I've paraphrased anybody 
incorrectly, I will be glad to retract if 
anyone is miffed.



The article makes four main points.


1) Absence of critical clauses. 


In this case, the idea is that the licence 
is invalid because it doesn't specify
under what country's law the GPL is governed.


2) Specification in English only.

That for the end user (as opposed to businesses), 
the GPL doesn't apply because it's not written 
in French.


3) Arbitary licence change.

The point here is that (under French law) the 
author can change the terms of the licence 
arbitarily. This is because any granting of 
rights by an author must be clearly delimited
in terms of how long, where, to whom, dates and 
times. In the absence of such limitations, the 
original author has the right to change his 
software back to closed on a whim.


{

David Neary makes the point that the copyright 
holder automatically retains the right to change 
the licence.

Scott replies it simply requires authorisation from 
all *copyright holders*

That's not my understanding. French law allows a 
GPL type licence *_on condition_* that the 
specific conditions of the granting of such
rights are clear - if they are not, there is
nothing to stop the original author taking
back ""his work"". The lawyers see this
(correctly IMHO) as a weakness in the GPL).

}



4) Hidden defects.

Roughly, this clause means that the author(s) 
is/are liable for any defects if the consumer 
is not an IT engineer, so if Linux blows up 
and data is lost, then the authors are liable.


{

Ciaran Johnson says that M$oft and others have 
similar clauses - the point here is that they 
are *_all_* invalid - just that this one 
affects the GPL also.

Niall O'Broinn makes the point that it is not
a sale, but rather a service/leasing arrangement
and that's why it doesn't come under this point.

I would suggest that the whole thrust of this
article has been to see software ""sales"" (even
if no money changes hands) as governed very
much by consumer law (in France anyway).


Rick Moen makes the point that it is not
a sale but rather a granting of rights which
are not default. 

See the bit about even the granting of 
rights by an author having to be 
explicitly specified - under French law.


The fact that two IP lawyers in France think that
the GPL is covered as a sale make me feel that 
there is a de facto sale and a de facto contract.

}



5) Roughly.

There may be other reasons under French 
law why the  GPL may be invalid.



-----  Whole Article. -----------


Freedom(a) is worth more than these 
imperfect licences.


Specialised lawyers look at the GPL.



Lawyer Cyril Rojinsky (duly appointed to 
the court) and the jurist Vincent Grynbaum, both 
specialised in the area of intellectual property 
examine the ""free"" licences and in particular the 
GPL. They have published their study
in the review ""Proprietes intellectuelles 
(Intellectual property)[1]"" and their
conclusion is grim.


Their approach is interesting. The problem for 
them is not to know whether freedom is valid under 
French law (for them the question is a moot point)
but rather they asked themselves about the form 
and the content of the text of free licences, and 
in particular the GPL. The problem is not free 
programmes, but rather the licence contracts of 
free programmes.



Absence of critical clauses.



The authors tell us that first of all, the 
reference to ""copyright"" is not legally 
sufficient in the framework of international 
contracts  (which is the case of licence 
contracts for programmes developed and spread 
via the Internet). The idea of copyright can 
basically include differences from one country 
to another. This is why, under international 
contracts, it is necessary to specify to which 
laws one is referring (French law, American &c.).

The authors only found three public licences 
which were correctly formulated on this point: 
QPL, IBM Public Licence and the Mozilla Public
Licence).



Specification in the English language.



Next, the authors remind us that (at least in 
France), no clause in a contract may be contrary 
to French law [2]. However, it turns out that a 
licence such as the GPL is contrary to French law 
in several respects. Firstly, it is written in 
English and the FSF doesn't officially approve 
translations. 

The ""Toubon law"" obliges this sort 
of contract to be written in French, including for 
businesses since the notion of ""user"" applies not 
only to consumers, but also to businesses, 
professionals &c. 


Contacted by the editors of LinuxFrench, 
lawyer Cyril Rojinsky declared that, as 
far as business is concerned, the ""Toubon 
law"" is probably doomed to change since 
it is in contradiction of European directives 
on the subject, but whatever about that, the 
problem is still valid for individuals, and 
while waiting for it (French law) to change, 
French companies have to deal with it, since 
it is the law of the land.


A programme under the GPL can suddenly 
change licence.


Another problem, much more serious, is 
that according to French law, the author of 
a free programme can, at any time, invoke 
the invalidity of the licence for this 
software by simply changing the licence.


In effect, the law of intellectual 
property stipulates that the granting of  
rights by the author is subordinate to 
the condition that each of these granted 
rights be the object of a distinct clause 
in the granting act (i.e. the licence) and 
that the granting of any such rights be 
delimited with respect to its scope and its 
grantees, and also with respect to its 
location (i.e. where such rights may be 
excersised)  and duration of any such grants. 
[3] This is not the case of the GPL nor of
other free licences. Briefly, this means 
that in France, or elsewhere if the author 
is French, that which is under the GPL could 
revert to proprietary from one day to the next. 
 


The problem of the guarantee ""hidden defects"".


An other very serious flaw is that of the 
guarantee. The GPL licences and others show 
that the software is delivered ""without 
guarantee"". You are going to immediately
reply that commercical programmes carry the 
same clause in their licence contracts,
and this is correct. However, whatever is 
written in a licence contract, one cannot
free oneself from the ""guarantee from 
hidden defects"", since it is imposed in the 
Civil Code. This concept is poorly understood 
by the layman, it protects the buyer
(whoever it may be, individual or business, 
since it specifies the Civil Code and not 
consumer protection law) against hidden 
defects, deliberate or made in good faith by 
the seller. 


For example, if one buys a pair of socks 
in a sale, and the shop has a notice 
specifying that ""Sale items are neither 
refunded nor exchanged"", and on arriving 
home you notice that one of the socks has 
a hole in it, several scenarios are possible.


You could have checked the socks before 
purchase: the flaw is deemed ""obvious"" and
you can sing for your money.


You couldn't check the socks (they were 
packaged for example), and in this case, 
despite the notice ""neither refund nor 
exchange"", you may invoke ""hidden defect"" 
and have them changed or obtain a refund, 
it's up to you. 

Personally, I have already invoked in shops 
the ""hidden defect"" clause and it always 
worked well (shopkeepers are always very 
cooperative if you quote a couple of words 
of the Civil Code). 


The concept of hidden defect is rather 
wide, it is necessary that you hadn't 
the possibility of discovering the defect 
before buying the product and then 
(according to the Civil Code) that you 
wouldn't have bought it at that price if 
you had known about the
defect.


The third case which is much rarer , is 
if you are able to show that the vendor had
knowledge of the defect (hidden), but didn't 
inform you. In this case, not only does he 
have to reimburse the product, but all 
expenses incurred by the sale (metro 
tickets to go to the shop, the fuse 
which blew when you plugged it in &c.)


This idea of ""hidden defect"" applies to
 all products, including programmes. This 
was made abundantly clear by the 
authorities (and the courts) surrounding 
Y2K. 

This is particularly inconvenient for 
free programmes, since a site which 
offers a Linux distro for download is 
supposed to provide a guarantee against 
hidden flaws.


LinuxFrench asked Cyril ROJINSKY if 
in the case of a free programme, 
one could speak about a ""hidden"" defect 
since the source code was available, 
he replied ""Actually, concerning the 
guarantee, the question of obvious 
defect will arise. This analyis will 
be different depending on whether the 
person who downloads the distribution 
is an IT professional or not"". 

OpenSource has this advantage over 
the proprietary programme: it protects 
the distributor against a guarantee of
hidden defect insofar as the buy is an 
IT person. But, for distribution to the 
public at large, the problem remains 
the same.



Roughly Speaking.


Lawyer Cyril ROJINSKY said it himself, 
this study is far from being exhaustive 
and many other areas could be explored. 

During this interview, we asked ourselves, 
for example, about the fragility of the 
GPL clause which forbids linking source 
code under the GPL with proprietary code. 

In effect, the laws of intellectual 
property give the right to the user 
to modify a programme with the
intention of permitting interoperability 
with another programme. If for that,
I need to link with a proprietary library 
(communication protocol, device driver)
I may consider as ""null and void"" this 
clause of the GPL.


The conclusion of this study is a wake 
up call for the community. ""Freedom"" 
merits more than these shoddy licences, 
which should be modified before court 
cases over them proliferate and put at 
risk the undeniable originality of 
this effort.

[2] Une telle clause de contrat

française est qualifiée en terme 
juridique de « clause réputée 
non-écrite », c'est-à-dire 
qu'on fait comme si cette clause 
n'était pas écrite dans le contrat. 

C'est pour cela par exemple que vous 
pouvez signer un bail pour un 
appartement qui stipule que 
les enfants sont interdits dans 
l'immeuble, et envisager sans 
inquiétude d'avoir quand même 
un enfant, en effet le code civil 
stipule que le devoir d'un locataire 
d'un appartement doit se comporter 
en « bon père de famille »

Here are the new scores in the 2.40 branch (they may change, but they
are better than before).

score INVALID_MSGID                  1.226
score MSG_ID_ADDED_BY_MTA            1.696
score MSG_ID_ADDED_BY_MTA_2          0.532

Total of 3.5 which is better than 7.4, I suppose.

If they fixed their MSGID, it would help.  I suppose we could allow
comments without hurting spam detection too much, but I'm reluctant
(it's pretty bizarre to put a comment after the Message-ID header).

Can you open a bugzilla ticket for this one?

Dan

Some classics from this period, now in a new English translation:
""The Sagas of Icelanders"" in trade paperback, from (duh) Viking, in 2000.
Remaindered at my local Barnes & Ignoble.   The historical reference 
material is useful.

Do I need to do anything to recreate anything after deleting this?

I did notice an rpm I made the other day didn't work, and just sat there 
for ages  seemingly doing nothing, which probably did this :(

Ok, now I get:


Fetched 88.1kB in 2m31s (581B/s)

fetchmail adds Received headers?  That seems wrong.  I'll open a bug
to investigate.  Can you attach some examples?

Agreed.  At least you can add information with email.

Then this may be 6 months or more since my guess after 3 beta releases is
that the freeze on package versions for inclusion in the next stable
release (n+1) has already happened, thus you'll have to wait at least for
Red Hat Linux... n+2 :-)

This is why (if it doesn't break anything), I'll maybe release recent
aspell packages. But to be sure I'll need to do some testing ;-)

(This is all guess work and may be bogus.)

Are you running Gnome 1.4? I had similar problems as did several
co-workers. Updating my Gnome components has fixed it for me and
others, although I can't say exactly which component did the
trick. Gnomecore or gtk would seem most likely, but it may have been
something else.

In any case, I have not seen the problem for quite a while, now.

Hi,

Is it possible to use razor without filtering empty mails as spamm?
An mail with an attachment is considered spamm. Is this normal?
Or I mysqlf like to send emails to myself where all important is said in
subject and body is empty (for remaining smth).

Thanks,
Raido Kurel

First, misattribution.  I did not write the blurb below.  I made one
statement about VP Cheney only, to wit, that he has a short memory.

I couldn't agree with you more on this: ""in short, then, economics is not a
zero sum game, property is not theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs
of the poor, and redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit
is just that: horseshit, happy or otherwise,"" however, I resent being lumped
in a zero-sum-zealot category for suggesting nothing more than that rich and
successful at face value is apropos of nothing and I am beginning to
understand that people who immediately and so fiercely object to my ad
hominem (re Cheney) align themselves weird sylogisms like ""if rich then
deservedly"" or ""if rich then smarter.""  Given that, I am also beginning to
understand why some people NEED to be rich.

WRT to meritocracies - all hail, meritocracies!  WRT Harvard: over 90% of
2002 graduates were cum laude +. INTERESTING curve.  Those eager to be
measured got their wish; those unwashed shy folk who just live it provide
the balast.

Speaking of Forbes, was reading about Peter Norton just today in an old
issue while waiting for my doctor.  Norton attributes his success to LUCK.
Imagine.

Actually, if I remember correctly from discussion of the list's
composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to
get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say
""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could...

[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,
like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught
you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of
*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get
around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing
transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's
government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of
innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this
summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out
there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]


The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a
""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the
best school possible.

Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,
for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,
ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the
years for proof.

Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after
World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,
Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who
goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually
afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who
couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the
last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,
and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.


The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal""
degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or
learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss
basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after
death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people
who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*
smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.

BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this
rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to
beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You
were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to
Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,
much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on
this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with
educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The
facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.
There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and
economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including
ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,
intelligence and effort.

[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of
competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,
apparently.]



BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,
*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,
all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and
there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,
most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have
*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically
all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and
not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.

That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The
People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better
stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept
apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd
know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase
in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about
extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who
doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some
politician as Santa Claus come election time...


In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not
theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and
redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just
that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.

To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx
wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.

Cheers,
RAH

SA (and other filters) could be configured to ignore the SWE mark if it 
appears to come from/through China.

SA could also be configured so that SWE marks are ignored in messages that 
look like third-party spam (like stock scams).  Of course, this would still 
mean that ""The U.N. is going to invade America!"" spams with SWE would get 
through.  Probably also need to ignore SWE in messages that look like 
Nigerian scams.

Yeah, but these would be different cases relating to copyright infringements,
not about ISP's blocking mail or not.

At Fermi (yes I'm back there; long story), we're buying 4U systems like 
the fiscal year is ending.  We have ~20 ASA IR4US1 systems (not pushing 
them, there are some other similar units available), with 60 more on 
order.  They're 2-1/2 TB for $10K, although we add a separate IDE or 
SCSI system disk, because the 3Ware RAID controllers can saturate. 
Intel SDS2 motherboard, 2 1.4GHz P3s, 2 GB ram, 2 3Ware 7850 Raid 
controllers, 16 160GB Maxtors, SysKonnect gigabit enet, Fermi RedHat 7.3.

http://www.asacomputers.com/cgi-bin/index.fcg?action=displayscreen&templateid=25

There's some interesting info at:

http://mit.fnal.gov/~msn/cdf/caf/server_evaluation.html

We've decided to go with XFS (which Linus has just merged into the 2.5 
tree), mostly because none of the other journaled fs's can maintain >30 
GB/s rates with a nearly full filesystem (mostly GB files) with random 
deletions (we use these systems for caching our 2 petabyte tape store). 
  Ext3 almost did it but dropped from from ~38MB/s to 10 with random 
deletions, and didn't want to do direct io at all.  Only concern is an 
occasional system lock-up we haven't chased down yet.  A load avg > 100 
is always a patio of fun.

Oddly, even fairly beefy systems like these will breathe hard to keep up 
with the new STK 9940B tape drives, which crank along at a steady 
30GB/s.  And you oldforktimers will remember ""doofus"" my old file server 
system.  It would only take 2.1"" of rackspace now, instead of 14 racks.

Cheers,
Wayne

List-Id: Irish Linux Users' Group <ilug.linux.ie>

Hello again. I tried all the suggestions for the PCTel driver and at the end of it, everything still goes smoothly until I type ""make"" after I get the output from the ./configure. 

However, there were a couple of things I noticed along the way. After typing 
* cp configs/kernel-2.4...config .config
* make oldconfig
* make dep
The 2nd to last line I got back said that the modversions.h file was not updated. When I looked at this path to the modversions.h file, it was 281 lines and every line started with a # mark. Is it the case that nothing is read on a line after a # mark (or am I just thinking of another language?) and so should I delete the # at certain places?

Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed ""make"", I noticed that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h file. Inside this other file, there's nothing at all. And so I moved the modversions.h file with 281 lines to the empty modversions.h file - and got a different reply after ""make"". The output after I moved the file over mostly looked like this:
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:11:33: linux/modules/adb.ver: No such file or directory
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:12:37: linux/modules/af_ax25.ver: No such file or directory
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:13:36: linux/modules/af_ipx.ver: No such file or directory

The odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are what's written after the # in the modversions.h file. Should there be a file at each of these (one at each of the 281 lines of the file) that I'd have to compile/make?

It's taken plenty of elbow grease, but I'm glad it hasn't gone smoothly, it's a good learning experience. Again, any help is appreciated. Thanks, Eric

The astounding thing about java is that despite all of the many significant 
points in its favor, it still manages to suck, and break across JVMs.

I was really looking forward to being able to use a better language like 
java and get it compiled to real platform-specific binaries via the GNU 
compiler collection.   But this seems to have never really gotten anywhere 
because it would require porting or reimplementing libraries, which are 
probably not source-available or tolerably licenced.   When I looked at 
what I had to do to gcc and link ""hello world,"" I lost interest.

Who the hell is writing the runtimes, anyway?   Why are Perl/Python/Ruby 
more reliable?   In a world where the Macs all ran emulated 68K code 
utterly reliably, it's just hard to accept that there can't be a single 
portable JVM that just works.

My opinion is biased because of the disgraceful state of non-Windoze 
browser java implementations.

You're probably right, mine's just the same but with the cream added to the 
eggs.  I guess I should try it without.  Actually looking on the internet for a 
recipe I found this one from possibly one of the scariest people I've ever seen, 
and he's a US Congressman:
<http://www.virtualcities.com/ons/me/gov/megvjb1.htm>

That's one of the worst non-smiles ever.

Maybe you never bought a hot dog from a street vendor.

Well, yes.  But it doesn't change the idea that the margin of survival
probably IS that thin in this region.

I'm not.  I'm sure both sides were equally ready to be the aggressor
provided they were in a predominant position of power.

1. Which religion and how it is currently being expressed matters.
2. The US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim religion.
3. US Leadership remains reflexively multi-cultural.

I didn't say burning the train was a good thing.  I said I understood it
wasn't a spontaneous attack on people who had done no wrong.

There has been a significant recent increase in global CO2 concentrations.
The vast preponderance of the new CO2 in the atmosphere is due to human
activity starting around the industrialization of Europe, and accelerating
after WWII. Most scientists studying global climate change believe that
these increased CO2 concentrations are the primary causal agent for
increased global warming. Hence our interest in items of human time scale.

Most global climate change scientists would agree that temperatures in the
past have often been much warmer than today. The point of global warming
isn't to save the Earth -- the planet is not sentient. The point is to
understand and potentially reduce the impact of increasing temperatures on
global human activity.

The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is due to human activity.

It is generally accepted that increases in CO2 in a closed environment
subject to solar heating retain more of that solar energy. This is the
current best explanation for the high temperature of Venus. If the CO2
concentration goes up globally (which it has), then theory states the earth
should be retaining greater solar energy. This process may be slow, and may
be difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide. I
encourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking CO2 to
eventual increases in global energy content, part of which will be evident
as heat.

I am using SuSe 7.3 - intalled SDK with no problems. All tests passed.

When I try to make the 2.14 agents I get all kinds of errors. In
particuliar it says the net::dns is missing. But it seems to be there. The
SDK test passes it.

Any help would be appreciated.

Like what exactly? All the problems are in chemisty and physics and biology

Yes, but doing it an order of magnitude or 2 easier does :) Which with the
way things are now, is not hard at all to do.

http://www.snopes.com/quotes/bush.htm

Claim:   President George W. Bush proclaimed, ""The problem with
the French is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.""

Status:   False.

Origins:   Yet another French fried ""George W. Bush is dumb""
story has been taken up by those who like their caricatures
drawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that
emerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President
Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,
the decline of the French economy. ""The problem with the
French,"" Bush afterwards confided in Blair, ""is that they don't
have a word for entrepreneur.""

The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness
Williams of Crosby, who claimed ""my good friend Tony Blair"" had
recently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.

Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness
Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did
receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of
communications and strategy. ""I can tell you that the prime
minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly
never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,""
Campbell told The Post. ""If she put this in a speech, it must
have been a joke.""

This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of
a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than
stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories
too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've
chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the
moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the
ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged
as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the
intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus
quatrain which pontificated that the ""village idiot"" would win
the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it
was the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks
to chortling up their sleeves.

Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual
shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they
seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this
public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever
been. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at
some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always
fall upon appreciative ears.

That is a fully retarded view of economics, and pretty much the same kind
of clueless oversimplication that led to the blackouts.  There are a
bazillion factors that affect game strategies, which is what the state of
California messed up and the energy producers exploited.

I'm not convinced that the only way to prevent future energy debacles like
the blackouts is to reregulate.  Ultimately we have to blame the people
who crafted the game rules in a way that invited blackouts and
exploitation.  Given that the particular set of rules crafted by the state
of California sucked, does there exist a set of rules that doesn't suck?  
If there does exist a better set of rules, then reregulation isn't
necessarily the answer.

You can't blame businesses for being profit maximizers.  Yes, the people 
involved were heartless and corrupt.  But mainly they just did their 
jobs.

The guilty parties are either the mathematicians and economists who wrote
the rules or, if the mathematicians and economists said there were no good
rules, pro-deregulation politicians who went ahead anyway.

Great piece on the pulp comic characters that appear in the new series of Alan 
Moore's _League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Tom Strong_ (thanks, Zed) funnybook. 
These characters, like The Terror and The Fighting Yank, are in the public 
domain because their original publishers didn't register (or renew, it's 
unclear) their copyright, which means that they've been granted a new lease on 
life in _Tom Strong_. The article segues into a very good discussion of the 
public domain. This was just Slashdotted, so it might be a little slow, but 
it's worth the wait. Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via /.[3]_)

I have one that uses dist to send stuff from my work mail to my 
home mail.  The binding looks like this:

set {bindings(key,HD_Dist_Silently -form distcomps.to-me)} <Meta-dollar>

The ""HD_Dist_Silently"" is a hacked up version of the proc that 
does dist in exmh and is pasted in below.  It's getting old and 
probably should be ""resynced"" with the current code.  But it 
still works (on a relatively recent CVS copy of exmh)

It's also possible that there's an easier way but I hacked this 
together quickly a year or more ago and when it worked I moved 
on to other tasks.

--Hal

proc HD_Dist_Silently { args } {

    global exmh msg
    set exmh(ctype) {dist}
    if {[string length $args] == 0} {
	set args Mh_DistSetup
    }

    if [MsgOk $msg(id) m] {
	if {[string compare [info command $args] $args] == 0} {
	    # Old interface with hook procedure
	    if [catch {$args $exmh(folder) $m} err] {   ;# Setup draft msg
		Exmh_Status ""${args}: $err"" purple
		return
	    }
	}  else {
	    if [catch {
		Exmh_Status ""dist +$exmh(folder) $m""
		eval {MhExec dist +$exmh(folder) $m} -nowhatnowproc $args
		MhAnnoSetup $exmh(folder) $m dist
	    } err] {
		Exmh_Status ""dist: $err"" purple
		return
	    }
	}
        Edit_Done send				;# Just send it
    }
}

zactly. I started off doing clever clever things, and, as always with
this stuff, found that stupid with a rock beats smart with scissors,
every time.

Point the first, I doubt if they are trying to change Rumsy's mind but
rather to show others that there is a vocal and violent opposition to his
views. With such flagrant showings of opposition there would be more
coverage of the opposing ideas and thus the spreading of the dissenting
meme. A viri need not comply with the wishes of the attacked host, rather
the host had better make some antibodies or learn to adapt.

Point the second. Historicaly the ""in yer face"" mode of confrontation has
been used to gain popular support and to grow from seeds ""grass roots""
movements. Witness the big bold ""in yer face"" signature of Hancock on the
""in yer  face"" Declaration of the american colonies to the governing
powers of england. Witness also the chicago seven, Others will follow in
examplare  form upon digging.

Now point the third, is it annoying? Yes, and if your annoyed then the ""in
yer facers"" have done thier job. Sad to say the polite persnikiters are
teh very fule the ""in yer facers"" hope to ignite. If your burning, your
being used.

Pointed the personal...The politics of the polite are more often the
refuge of backstabings,  closed mouth recourlessness and hypocritcal
behavoirs. Id rather hear what those who oppose me have to say than
quietly be knifed by the slow hand of the coward.



Seek not the polite or impolite but rather the reasons why.

Just tried smartgroups: The layout of pages is pretty challenging to
use quickly, but the most interesting aspect is that once you are in,
there is no way to get out.  You can unsubscribe yourself as the sole
member of a group, but you cannot delete the group.

Or if you can, I couldn't find it before deleting myself, and now it's
invisible to me.  Another interesting thing: Security forms are reset
to full-public settings each time you load them, rather than set from
your current settings.

All in all, I wasn't impressed and have stayed with the Yahooligans
for another run.

Too, too, too, true.  Just you try to muck with Job's blessed Aqua 
interface.   Or remove the fscking dock.  OSX is such a step down from 
Classic with Kaleidoscope skinning the entire UI.  As an artist, I resent 
it deeply.   (This is not in praise of Classic.)  If my environment cannot 
be made beautiful, in some sense I cannot live.

It was the Spring of 1979.  

I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...

Stealing other kids' lunch money.

No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,
""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.

Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.

I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.

Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.

First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.

Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.

The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""NEVER"".  

In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:

Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?

Hell no!

You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  

The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.

If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.

What I'm talking about here is day trading.  

My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. 

The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  

I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.

Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  

The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  

Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.

They make their money only if you believe two lies:

1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.

2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.

Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...

The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  

After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:

** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.

** Anyone can do it.

** It only takes a few hours to learn.

When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.

After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.

The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. 

Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year 

After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. 

Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:

*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.


*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.


*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 


*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.


*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 


*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 


*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.


*** Make money on the biggest news stories.


*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 


*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.


*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 


It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and

Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?

coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.

White House: President's ""War Boner"" Must Be Satisfied

...""The President can't seem to hide his excitement about a possible
military conflict with Iraq. At a recent function honoring America's
war widows, Bush sported a visible erection when his speech turned to
the subject of the Middle East.

'Believe me when I say this. With or without the help of other
nations, with or without UN approval, we will penetrate Iraq's
borders. With overwhelming force, we will pound Iraq over and over
again without ceasing. And, once its leaders concede defeat, we will
seed Iraq with American-style democracy.'

Aides say the podium was scrubbed down thoroughly after the event with
a special cleanser/biocide not used since the Clinton
administration."".....

Should I expect problems if my apt server is running RH 7.3/Apt 0.3 and
some clients are coming on line and will be running RH 8.0/Apt 0.5? Do
the two different version interoperate?

Thanks,

Thank you, that was exactly what I needed.
DVD works great now.
1 more problem?
Video-DVDRip worked on RH 7.3 but can't get contents of DVD, last
message is 'libdvdread: using libdvdcss 1.2.2 for DVD access'.
but it fails.

It sounds like the flow control is set to Xon/Xoff rather than hardware.

Unusual -  8 n 1 is more common.

I think that the AT command for hardware flow control is &E4 though this
may vary from modem to modem.

more accurately: someone's dream changes reality for everyone, and
everyone's memory adjusts to perceive the new realities as a continuum,
replete with new pasts and new memories.

ever have dreams that ""create"" their own history to make their irrealities
plausible and authentic feeling?

ever notice how the feelings evoked in some dreams stick with you all day?
i'm sure it's some neurochemical process initiated during the dream that is
still cycling thru - like a deja vu, triggered by memory processes, where
you don't actually remember but you feel like you're remembering.

Ok, Iknow this is blatantly OT but I'm beginning to go insane.
Had an old Dell Dimension XPS sitting in the corner and decided to
put it to use, I know it was working pre being stuck in the
corner, but when I plugged it in, hit the power nothing happened.
I opened her up and had a look and say nothing much. A little orange
LED comes on when I plug her in but that's it, after some googling
I found some reference to re-seating all the parts, but no change.
The problem I'm having is that since the power supply is some Dell
specific one, ATX block with what looks like one of the old AT
power connectors, I cant figure out weather this is a Mobo prob
or a PSU prob. Just to futily try and drag this back OT, I want
to install Linux on it when I get it working. If anyone knows
what the problem might be give me a shout.

Cheers,
Peter.

A terrible argument. There are better technical solutions to privacy
protection than sending a copy of the same message to everyone on the
Internet, so the recipients can't be blamed for reading it.

Wait till phone spam is as cheap to send as email spam...

Absolutely correct. Perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about 
life on Earth today.

The following is a fascinating document of official Government policy 
that bears close reading. It is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in 
an imperfect world.

I was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of Radio Sawa, 
our new music-and-news channel for 15-30 year old Arabs. It's #1 in 
practically every market it's entered, nearing 90% listenership in 
Amman. And it's even beginning to be trusted for news, well past BBC and 
taking share from every other government broadcaster.

It is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long-term 
as it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term.

Many of you may disagree, but I found the document below surprisingly 
centrist. If you know the code, you can hear clearly partisan tones, re: 
ICC, Taiwan Relations Act, etc. But, still, this is as much a Democratic 
platform as not. Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared 
they might.

As you read, replace ""United States"" with ""Roman Empire"" and it may make 
as much sense, in the long view of history. I don't know how proud to be 
about that, but it is telling. Sometime I daydream that the President 
might sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to 
our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700+ military installations 
overseas and what they do for us. It would be a powerful education on 
how engaged we are in the world around us.

Heck, I'd love to see a real-time map of Federal expenditures around the 
globe, a softly glowing necklace of embassies, carriers, arctic research 
stations, hotels, golf courses, warehouses, libraries, clinics and all 
the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy.

Of course, this still doesn't leave me any more comfortable with the 
real news in this document: the Bush Doctrine for pre-emptive strikes. 
I'd sooner repeal the Church amendments on covert action than permit 
such a principle to be loosed upon the world.

Full Text: Bush's National Security Strategy

Following is the full text of President Bush's new national security 
strategy. The document, entitled ""The National Security Strategy of the 
United States,"" will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of 
the Administration's policy.

INTRODUCTION

THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and 
totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of 
freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom, 
democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only 
nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and 
guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the 
potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People 
everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them; 
worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own 
property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom 
are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of 
protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of 
freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.

Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military 
strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our 
heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for 
unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that 
favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies 
can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and 
economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the 
world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace 
against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace 
by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the 
peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.

Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental 
commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed 
dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great 
industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of 
individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less 
than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to 
penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies 
against us.

To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal -- 
from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and 
cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global 
reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help 
nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will 
hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the 
allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and 
countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop 
new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every 
turn.

The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism 
and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking 
weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing 
so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to 
succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other 
means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny, 
contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous 
technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America 
will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We 
cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must 
be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence 
and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who 
saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have 
entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.

As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic 
opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community 
has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 
seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace 
instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers 
find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist 
violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common 
interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by 
common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching 
for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese 
leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of 
national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political 
freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage 
the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations, 
because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and 
international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great 
powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity, 
trade, and cultural advancement.

Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend 
the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring 
the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to 
every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us 
that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our 
national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people 
into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and 
corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and 
drug cartels within their borders.

The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a 
better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free 
trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies 
out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual 
nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to 
build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity. 
The United States will deliver greater development assistance through 
the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly, 
invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also 
continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of 
AIDS and other infectious diseases.

In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is 
guided by the conviction that all nations have important 
responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror. 
Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the 
spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international 
aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For 
freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.

We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer, 
better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply 
the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed 
to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade 
Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as 
other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment 
these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations 
are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to 
rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.

Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of 
every person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has 
been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the 
clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and 
it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity 
holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all 
these foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in 
this great mission.

I. Overview of America's International Strategy


""Our Nation's cause has always been larger than our Nation's defense. We 
fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors 
liberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists 
and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among 
the great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and 
open societies on every continent.""






President Bush
West Point, New York

The United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength 
and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of 
liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with 
unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great 
strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that 
favors freedom.

For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great 
struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and 
equality.

That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and 
race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and 
discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we 
are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by 
catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must 
defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.

This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to 
translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity, 
and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a 
distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our 
values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help 
make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to 
progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations 
with other states, and respect for human dignity.

And this path is not America's alone. It is open to all.

To achieve these goals, the United States will:

*	champion aspirations for human dignity;

*	strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent 
attacks against us and our friends;

*	work with others to defuse regional conflicts;

*	prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our 
friends, with weapons of mass destruction;

*	ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and 
free trade;

*	expand the circle of development by opening societies and building 
the infrastructure of democracy;

*	develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of 
global power; and

*	transform America's national security institutions to meet the 
challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.


II. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity


""Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the 
language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require 
different methods, but not different moralities.""





President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002



In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we 
stand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because 
these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation 
owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and 
mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live 
free from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be 
oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of 
the secret police.

America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human 
dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state; 
free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women; 
religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.

These demands can be met in many ways. America's constitution has served 
us well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures, 
facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these 
core principles into their own systems of governance. History has not 
been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and 
aspirations of their people.

Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in 
our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of 
Independence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a 
stronger, but is a freer and more just society.

Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And 
when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central 
and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When 
we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in 
the Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin 
America and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can 
evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all 
cherish.

Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today, 
the national security strategy of the United States must start from 
these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.

Our principles will guide our government's decisions about international 
cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation 
of resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international 
bodies.

We will:

*	speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of 
human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to 
advance freedom;

*	use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who 
struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward 
democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;

*	make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key 
themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation 
from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights 
to move toward a better future; and

*	take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience 
and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.


We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist 
it.

III. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent 
Attacks Against Us and Our Friends


""Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have 
the distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already 
clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been 
waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is 
peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on 
the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of 
our choosing.""





President Bush
Washington, D.C. (The National Cathedral)
September 14, 2001



The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of 
global reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or 
religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated, 
politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.

In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a 
lasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed 
within a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United 
States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals 
with them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who 
knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.

The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in 
our history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly 
elusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come 
through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some 
unseen.

Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can, 
and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to 
achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition 
forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not 
only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of 
trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South 
America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.

Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist 
organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command, 
control, and communications; material support; and finances. This will 
have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.

We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a 
coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional 
campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure 
the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial 
tools necessary to finish the task.

The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the 
financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of 
funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who 
support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial 
system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists, 
and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative 
financial networks.

However, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the 
cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we 
seek.

We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:

*	direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and 
international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist 
organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of 
terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction 
(WMD) or their precursors;

*	defending the United States, the American people, and our interests 
at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it 
reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to 
enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate 
to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by 
acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing 
harm against our people and our country; and

*	denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists 
by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign 
responsibilities.


We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international 
terrorism. This includes:

*	using the full influence of the United States, and working closely 
with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are 
illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as 
slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government 
can condone or support and all must oppose;

*	supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim 
world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote 
terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;

*	diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by 
enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources 
on areas most at risk; and

*	using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of 
information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of 
those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.


While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also 
strengthening America's homeland security to protect against and deter 
attack.

This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization 
since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council 
and the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland 
Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental 
reordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland 
encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public 
and the private sector.

This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example, 
emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with 
terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened 
to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and 
mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop 
terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.

While our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism 
in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends. 
Wherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations 
and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where 
governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we 
will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and 
our allies can provide.

As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work 
with international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as 
non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the 
humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to 
rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people, 
threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists

In the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are 
ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom 
and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this 
conflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new, 
productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in 
ways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.

IV. Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts


""We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion. 
The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements 
look so small.""





President Bush
Berlin, Germany
May 23, 2002



Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional 
disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In 
an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our 
alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create 
horrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states 
falter, the United States will work with friends and partners to 
alleviate suffering and restore stability.

No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action -- 
direct or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic, 
and military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States 
will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:

*	The United States should invest time and resources into building 
international relationships and institutions that can help manage local 
crises when they emerge.

*	The United States should be realistic about its ability to help 
those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when 
people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.


Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will 
apply these principles:

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of 
human suffering, because of America's close relationship with the state 
of Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region's importance 
to other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace 
for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed 
to an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in 
peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a 
government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and 
counts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all 
parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and 
comprehensive settlement to the conflict.

The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank 
stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic 
development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to 
establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If 
Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront 
corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support 
for the creation of a Palestinian state.

Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine. 
Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy. So the 
United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete 
steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state. 
As there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw 
fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent 
with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement 
activity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides, 
freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians 
to resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial 
role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and 
Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.

In South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India 
and Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested 
time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and 
Pakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a 
constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With 
Pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan's 
choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more 
open and tolerant society. The Administration sees India's potential to 
become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century 
and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our 
involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in 
bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan 
that can help defuse military confrontation.

Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and 
respect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting 
the rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to 
employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its 
neighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by 
Indonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.

In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with 
countries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil, 
Canada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic 
hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity, 
opportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as 
the Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States 
(OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of 
the entire hemisphere.

Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising 
from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict 
and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and 
security of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active 
strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce 
their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of 
drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs 
in our own country.

In Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist 
groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking 
activities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are 
working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat 
illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective 
sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic 
security to the Colombian people.

In Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war, 
and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United 
States -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority -- 
combating global terror. American interests and American principles, 
therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an 
African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity. 
Together with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa's 
fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous 
borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence 
infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.

An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars 
spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions 
of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to 
confronting these emerging transnational threats.

Africa's great size and diversity requires a security strategy that 
focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This 
administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the 
region:

*	countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South 
Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement 
and require focused attention;

*	coordination with European allies and international institutions is 
essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace 
operations; and

*	Africa's capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations 
must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational 
threats on a sustained basis.


Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the 
surest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are 
conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically 
waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to 
the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a 
common responsibility for democratic political systems offers 
opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.

V. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends 
with Weapons of Mass Destruction


""The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and 
technology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear 
weapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs, 
even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to 
strike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention, and 
have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the 
capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and 
we will oppose them with all our power.""





President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002



The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States -- with our 
allies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy's use of 
force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. With the 
collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, our security 
environment has undergone profound transformation.

Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our 
relationship with Russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the 
balance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear 
arsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as 
counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were 
inconceivable.

But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists. 
None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power 
that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union. However, the nature and 
motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain 
destructive powers hitherto available only to the world's strongest 
states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass 
destruction against us, make today's security environment more complex 
and dangerous.

In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue 
states that, while different in important ways, share a number of 
attributes. These states:

*	brutalize their own people and squander their national resources 
for the personal gain of the rulers;

*	display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors, 
and callously violate international treaties to which they are party;

*	are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with 
other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively 
to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;

*	sponsor terrorism around the globe; and

*	reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything 
for which it stands.


At the time of the Gulf War, we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq's 
designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against 
Iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear 
weapons and biological agents. In the past decade North Korea has become 
the world's principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested 
increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal. 
Other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as 
well. These states' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has 
become a looming threat to all nations.

We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients 
before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction 
against the United States and our allies and friends. Our response must 
take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new 
partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military 
forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective 
missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence 
collection and analysis.

Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes:

*	Proactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend 
against the threat before it is unleashed. We must ensure that key 
capabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce 
capabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our 
homeland security systems. Counterproliferation must also be integrated 
into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of 
our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD-armed 
adversaries.

*	Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and 
terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise 
necessary for weapons of mass destruction. We will enhance diplomacy, 
arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction 
assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, and when 
necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. We will 
continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their 
increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and 
threat reduction programs. The recent G-8 agreement to commit up to $20 
billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step 
forward.

*	Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD 
use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of 
WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such 
weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading 
enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. The United States 
must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our 
forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.


It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of 
this new threat. Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the 
United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have 
in the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy 
of today's threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be 
caused by our adversaries' choice of weapons, do not permit that option. 
We cannot let our enemies strike first.

*	In the Cold War, especially following the Cuban missile crisis, we 
faced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence was an 
effective defense. But deterrence based only upon the threat of 
retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states 
more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and 
the wealth of their nations.

*	In the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered 
weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who 
used them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons 
of choice. For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and 
military aggression against their neighbors. These weapons may also 
allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our 
allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior 
of rogue states. Such states also see these weapons as their best means 
of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States.

*	Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a 
terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the 
targeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death 
and whose most potent protection is statelessness. The overlap between 
states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to 
action.


For centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer 
an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves 
against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. Legal scholars 
and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption 
on the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible 
mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.

We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and 
objectives of today's adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not 
seek to attack us using conventional means. They know such attacks would 
fail. Instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use 
of weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed 
and delivered covertly and without warning.

The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian 
population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law 
of warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11, 2001, 
mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and 
these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired 
and used weapons of mass destruction.

The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions 
to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. The greater the 
threat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling 
the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if 
uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack. To 
forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United 
States will, if necessary, act preemptively.

The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging 
threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression. 
Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek 
the world's most destructive technologies, the United States cannot 
remain idle while dangers gather.

We will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our 
actions. To support preemptive options, we will:

*	build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide 
timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;

*	coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the 
most dangerous threats; and

*	continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to 
conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.


The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat 
to the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons for our 
actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.

VI. Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and 
Free Trade.


""When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a 
privileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever 
enough. When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in 
better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade 
revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively.""





President Bush
Monterrey, Mexico
March 22, 2002



A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing 
prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. Economic growth 
supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher 
incomes. It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs 
economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it 
reinforces the habits of liberty.

We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America's 
shores. All governments are responsible for creating their own economic 
policies and responding to their own economic challenge. We will use our 
economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of 
policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic 
growth, including:

*	pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business 
investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;

*	tax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that 
improve incentives for work and investment;

*	rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are 
confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic 
endeavors;

*	strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most 
efficient use;

*	sound fiscal policies to support business activity;

*	investments in health and education that improve the well-being and 
skills of the labor force and population as a whole; and

*	free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the 
diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and 
opportunity.


The lessons of history are clear: market economies, not 
command-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the 
best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. Policies that further 
strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for 
all economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the 
developing world.

A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U.S. 
national security interests. We want our allies to have strong economies 
for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake 
of global security. European efforts to remove structural barriers in 
their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are 
Japan's efforts to end deflation and address the problems of 
non-performing loans in the Japanese banking system. We will continue to 
use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners -- 
including through the Group of Seven (G-7) -- to discuss policies they 
are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher 
global economic growth.

Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic 
growth. International flows of investment capital are needed to expand 
the productive potential of these economies. These flows allow emerging 
markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise 
living standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term objective should be a 
world in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that 
allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in 
their future.

We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve 
access to larger capital flows at lower cost. To this end, we will 
continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial 
markets. We will work actively with other countries, the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), and the private sector to implement the G-7 Action 
Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and 
more effectively resolving them when they occur.

The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from 
occurring, and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing 
so. We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy 
conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on 
achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy, 
exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.

The concept of ""free trade"" arose as a moral principle even before it 
became a pillar of economics. If you can make something that others 
value, you should be able to sell it to them. If others make something 
that you value, you should be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the 
freedom for a person -- or a nation -- to make a living. To promote free 
trade, the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy:

*	Seize the global initiative. The new global trade negotiations we 
helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda, 
especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for 
completion in 2005. The United States has led the way in completing the 
accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade 
Organization. We will assist Russia's preparations to join the WTO.

*	Press regional initiatives. The United States and other democracies 
in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of 
the Americas, targeted for completion in 2005. This year the United 
States will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners, 
targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and 
government procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the 
poorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences 
allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free 
trade.

*	Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the 
free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001, the Administration 
will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and 
Singapore. Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of 
developed and developing countries in all regions of the world. 
Initially, Central America, Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will 
be our principal focal points.

*	Renew the executive-congressional partnership. Every 
administration's trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with 
Congress. After a gap of 8 years, the Administration reestablished 
majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing 
Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for 
developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002. This Administration will 
work with Congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade 
agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade 
Promotion Authority.

*	Promote the connection between trade and development. Trade 
policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights, 
competition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open 
societies, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional 
integration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in 
developing countries. The United States is implementing The Africa 
Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market-access for nearly all goods 
produced in the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We will make more 
use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue 
to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer 
countries take advantage of these opportunities. Beyond market access, 
the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public 
health. We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are 
flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical 
medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and 
malaria.

*	Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices. 
Commerce depends on the rule of law; international trade depends on 
enforceable agreements. Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing 
disputes with the European Union, Canada, and Mexico and to make a 
global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations 
that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. Laws 
against unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international 
community must be able to address genuine concerns about government 
subsidies and dumping. International industrial espionage which 
undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.

*	Help domestic industries and workers adjust. There is a sound 
statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used 
in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the 
American steel industry. The benefits of free trade depend upon the 
enforcement of fair trading practices. These safeguards help ensure that 
the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American 
workers. Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the 
change and dynamism of open markets.

*	Protect the environment and workers. The United States must foster 
economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with 
widening prosperity. We will incorporate labor and environmental 
concerns into U.S. trade negotiations, creating a healthy ""network"" 
between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO, and use the 
International Labor Organization, trade preference programs, and trade 
talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.

*	Enhance energy security. We will strengthen our own energy security 
and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our 
allies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and 
types of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere, 
Africa, Central Asia, and the Caspian region. We will also continue to 
work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient 
technologies.


Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize 
greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing 
them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the 
global climate. Our overall objective is to reduce America's greenhouse 
gas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such 
emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10 
years, by the year 2012. Our strategies for attaining this goal will be 
to:

*	remain committed to the basic U.N. Framework Convention for 
international cooperation;

*	obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of 
the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to 
companies that can show real cuts;

*	develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission 
reductions;

*	promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as 
well as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions, 
while also improving fuel economy for U.S. cars and trucks;

*	increase spending on research and new conservation technologies, to 
a total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change 
by any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year's 
budget; and

*	assist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas 
emitters such as China and India, so that they will have the tools and 
resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and 
better path.


VII. Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building 
the Infrastructure of Democracy


""In World War II we fought to make the world safer, then worked to 
rebuild it. As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we 
must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens.""





President Bush
Washington, D.C. (Inter-American
Development Bank)
March 14, 2002



A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human 
race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including 
all of the world's poor in an expanding circle of development -- and 
opportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of 
U.S. international policy.

Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic 
growth in the poorest countries. Worse, development aid has often served 
to prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and 
perpetuating misery. Results of aid are typically measured in dollars 
spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction 
achieved by recipients. These are the indicators of a failed strategy.

Working with other nations, the United States is confronting this 
failure. We forged a new consensus at the U.N. Conference on Financing 
for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and 
the strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.

This Administration's goal is to help unleash the productive potential 
of individuals in all nations. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is 
impossible without the right national policies. Where governments have 
implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels 
of assistance. The United States and other developed countries should 
set an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world's 
poorest economies within a decade.

The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to 
achieve this goal:

*	Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of 
national reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core 
development assistance given by the United States. While continuing our 
present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone, 
these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge 
Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest 
in their people, and encourage economic freedom. Governments must fight 
corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest 
in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and 
enable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward 
countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those 
that have not to implement reforms.

*	Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development 
banks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a 
comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other 
multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of 
the world's poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S. 
contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U.S. 
contributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the 
World Bank's fund for the poorest countries -- and the African 
Development Fund. The key to raising living standards and reducing 
poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially 
in the poorest countries. We will continue to press the multilateral 
development banks to focus on activities that increase economic 
productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law, 
and private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant 
must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in 
developing countries.

*	Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development 
assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world's 
poor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that 
more children are getting a better education, more people have access to 
health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a 
better future for their families. We have a moral obligation to measure 
the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering 
results. For this reason, we will continue to demand that our own 
development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral 
development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for 
achieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA 
replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation 
system that measures recipient countries' progress. For the first time, 
donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the 
achievement of actual development results, and part of the U.S. 
contribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the 
World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this 
progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything 
that these institutions do.

*	Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in 
the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants 
is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments, 
particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with 
ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA 
agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the 
poorest countries for education, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water, 
sanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress 
by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development 
banks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private 
sector to match government efforts by using grants to support 
development projects that show results.

*	Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are 
the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases, 
most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and 
foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows 
as well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national 
security strategy.

*	Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor 
countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics 
like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be 
threatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the 
developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest 
governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective 
local infrastructure. The United States has strongly backed the new 
global fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan 
and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for 
treatment and care. The United States already contributes more than 
twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the 
global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.

*	Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of 
democracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources 
are devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States 
will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20 
percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher 
training in Africa. The United States can also bring information 
technology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been 
devastated by AIDS.

*	Continue to aid agricultural development. New technologies, 
including biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields 
in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water. 
Using sound science, the United States should help bring these benefits 
to the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still 
suffer from hunger and malnutrition.


VIII. Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers 
of Global Power


""We have our best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 17th 
century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead 
of prepare for war.""





President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002



America will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions -- as 
broad as practicable -- of states able and willing to promote a balance 
of power that favors freedom. Effective coalition leadership requires 
clear priorities, an appreciation of others' interests, and consistent 
consultations among partners with a spirit of humility.

There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can 
accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies 
and friends in Canada and Europe. Europe is also the seat of two of the 
strongest and most able international institutions in the world: the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has, since its 
inception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter-European 
security, and the European Union (EU), our partner in opening world 
trade.

The attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO, as NATO itself 
recognized when it invoked its Article V self-defense clause for the 
first time. NATO's core mission -- collective defense of the 
transatlantic alliance of democracies -- remains, but NATO must develop 
new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new 
circumstances. NATO must build a capability to field, at short notice, 
highly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to 
respond to a threat against any member of the alliance.

The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened, 
creating coalitions under NATO's own mandate, as well as contributing to 
mission-based coalitions. To achieve this, we must:

*	expand NATO's membership to those democratic nations willing and 
able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;

*	ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate 
combat contributions to make in coalition warfare;

*	develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become 
effective multinational fighting forces;

*	take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of 
scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that 
they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;

*	streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to 
meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of 
training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations; 
and

*	maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as 
we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.


If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a 
partnership as central to the security and interests of its member 
states as was the case during the Cold War. We will sustain a common 
perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to 
take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. At the 
same time, we welcome our European allies' efforts to forge a greater 
foreign policy and defense identity with the EU, and commit ourselves to 
close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO. We 
cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of 
transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.

The attacks of September 11 energized America's Asian alliances. 
Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an 
attack on Australia itself, following that historic decision with the 
dispatch of some of the world's finest combat forces for Operation 
Enduring Freedom. Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented 
levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist 
attack. We have deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism with our 
alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received 
invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand.

The war against terrorism has proven that America's alliances in Asia 
not only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and 
ready to deal with new challenges. To enhance our Asian alliances and 
friendships, we will:


*	look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and 
global affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our 
close defense and diplomatic cooperation;

*	work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while 
preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of 
the region over the longer-term;

*	build on 50 years of U.S.-Australian alliance cooperation as we 
continue working together to resolve regional and global problems -- as 
we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora;

*	maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our 
allies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic 
environment; and

*	build on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with 
institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
forum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage 
change in this dynamic region.


We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power 
competition. Several potential great powers are now in the midst of 
internal transition -- most importantly Russia, India, and China. In all 
three cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly 
global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.

With Russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based 
on a central reality of the twenty-first century: the United States and 
Russia are no longer strategic adversaries. The Moscow Treaty on 
Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a 
critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive, 
long-term relations with the Euro-Atlantic community and the United 
States. Russia's top leaders have a realistic assessment of their 
country's current weakness and the policies -- internal and external -- 
needed to reverse those weaknesses. They understand, increasingly, that 
Cold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that 
Russian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas.

United States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to 
refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and 
challenges. We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the 
global war on terrorism. We are facilitating Russia's entry into the 
World Trade Organization, without lowering standards for accession, to 
promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. We have 
created the NATO-Russia Council with the goal of deepening security 
cooperation among Russia, our European allies, and ourselves. We will 
continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the 
former Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable 
neighborhood will reinforce Russia's growing commitment to integration 
into the Euro-Atlantic community.

At the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still 
divide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to 
build an enduring strategic partnership. Lingering distrust of our 
motives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our 
relations. Russia's uneven commitment to the basic values of free-market 
democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction remain matters of great concern. Russia's very 
weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. Nevertheless, those 
opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years -- or even 
decades.

The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral 
relationship with India based on a conviction that U.S. interests 
require a strong relationship with India. We are the two largest 
democracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative 
government. India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. We 
have a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through 
the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Finally, we share an interest 
in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia.

Differences remain, including over the development of India's nuclear 
and missile programs, and the pace of India's economic reforms. But 
while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about 
India, today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with 
which we have common strategic interests. Through a strong partnership 
with India, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic 
future.

The United States relationship with China is an important part of our 
strategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous Asia-Pacific 
region. We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous 
China. The democratic development of China is crucial to that future. 
Yet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst 
features of the Communist legacy, China's leaders have not yet made the 
next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state. 
In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its 
neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region, China is following an outdated 
path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national 
greatness. In time, China will find that social and political freedom is 
the only source of that greatness.

The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing 
China. We already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including 
the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean 
peninsula. Likewise, we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan 
and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter-terrorism and 
similar transitional concerns. Shared health and environmental threats, 
such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, challenge us to promote jointly the 
welfare of our citizens.

Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become 
more open with information, promote the development of civil society, 
and enhance individual human rights. China has begun to take the road to 
political openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting 
village-level elections, yet remains strongly committed to national 
one-party rule by the Communist Party. To make that nation truly 
accountable to its citizen's needs and aspirations, however, much work 
remains to be done. Only by allowing the Chinese people to think, 
assemble, and worship freely can China reach its full potential.

Our important trade relationship will benefit from China's entry into 
the World Trade Organization, which will create more export 
opportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers, workers, 
and companies. China is our fourth largest trading partner, with over 
$100 billion in annual two-way trade. The power of market principles and 
the WTO's requirements for transparency and accountability will advance 
openness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic 
protections for commerce and for citizens. There are, however, other 
areas in which we have profound disagreements. Our commitment to the 
self-defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one. Human 
rights is another. We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation 
commitments. We will work to narrow differences where they exist, but 
not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree.

The events of September 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for 
relations between the United States and other main centers of global 
power, and opened vast, new opportunities. With our long-standing allies 
in Europe and Asia, and with leaders in Russia, India, and China, we 
must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships 
become routine and unproductive.

Every agency of the United States Government shares the challenge. We 
can build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober 
analysis, and common action. In the long-term, these are the practices 
that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open 
the path of progress.

IX. Transform America's National Security Institutions to Meet the 
Challenges and Opportunities of the Twenty-First Century


""Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch 
its source. America is successful because of the hard work, creativity, 
and enterprise of our people.""





President Bush
Washington, D.C. (Joint Session of Congress)
September 20, 2001



The major institutions of American national security were designed in a 
different era to meet different requirements. All of them must be 
transformed.

It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength. 
We must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. Our military's 
highest priority is to defend the United States. To do so effectively, 
our military must:

*	assure our allies and friends;

*	dissuade future military competition;

*	deter threats against U.S. interests, allies, and friends; and

*	decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.


The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces, and their 
forward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world's most 
strategically vital regions. However, the threats and enemies we must 
confront have changed, and so must our forces. A military structured to 
deter massive Cold War-era armies must be transformed to focus more on 
how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might 
occur. We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational 
challenges.

The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound 
symbols of the U.S. commitments to allies and friends. Through our 
willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others, 
the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of 
power that favors freedom. To contend with uncertainty and to meet the 
many security challenges we face, the United States will require bases 
and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia, as 
well as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment 
of U.S. forces.

Before the war in Afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major 
planning contingencies. Yet, in a very short time, we had to operate 
across the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch 
of the armed forces. We must prepare for more such deployments by 
developing assets such as advanced remote sensing, long-range precision 
strike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces. 
This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the 
ability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure 
U.S. access to distant theaters, and protect critical U.S. 
infrastructure and assets in outer space.

Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new 
approaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting U.S. 
intelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and 
technology. We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is 
run, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention. 
Finally, while maintaining near-term readiness and the ability to fight 
the war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the President with a 
wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of 
coercion against the United States, our allies, and our friends.

We know from history that deterrence can fail; and we know from 
experience that some enemies cannot be deterred. The United States must 
and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy -- 
whether a state or non-state actor -- to impose its will on the United 
States, our allies, or our friends. We will maintain the forces 
sufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. Our forces 
will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a 
military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the 
United States.

Intelligence -- and how we use it -- is our first line of defense 
against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. Designed 
around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive, 
fixed object -- the Soviet bloc -- the intelligence community is coping 
with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of 
targets.

We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to 
keep pace with the nature of these threats. Intelligence must be 
appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems 
and coordinated with our allies and friends. We need to protect the 
capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the 
knowledge of how best to surprise us. Those who would harm us also seek 
the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and 
to maximize injury.

We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide 
integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. Since 
the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted 
inside the United States, we must also ensure the proper fusion of 
information between intelligence and law enforcement.

Initiatives in this area will include:

*	strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence 
to lead the development and actions of the Nation's foreign intelligence 
capabilities;

*	establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides 
seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing 
the nation and our allies;

*	continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to 
sustain our intelligence advantage;

*	investing in future capabilities while working to protect them 
through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence 
capabilities; and

*	collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the 
government with all-source analysis.


As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend 
America's interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other 
nations. We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding 
sufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy. The State 
Department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with 
other governments. And in this new era, its people and institutions must 
be able to interact equally adroitly with non-governmental organizations 
and international institutions. Officials trained mainly in 
international politics must also extend their reach to understand 
complex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public 
health, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.

Our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil 
wars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. As humanitarian relief 
requirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build 
police forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial 
government institutions, and electoral systems. Effective international 
cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by American 
readiness to play our part.

Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out 
to others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to 
public information efforts that can help people around the world learn 
about and understand America. The war on terrorism is not a clash of 
civilizations. It does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, 
a battle for the future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas 
and this is an area where America must excel.

We will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet 
our global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired 
by the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the 
International Criminal Court (ICC), whose jurisdiction does not extend 
to Americans and which we do not accept. We will work together with 
other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and 
cooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral 
agreements that will protect U.S. nationals from the ICC. We will 
implement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act, whose 
provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U.S. 
personnel and officials.

We will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the 
right level and allocation of government spending on national security. 
The United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this 
war. At home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for 
the American people.

Today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is 
diminishing. In a globalized world, events beyond America's borders have 
a greater impact inside them. Our society must be open to people, ideas, 
and goods from across the globe. The characteristics we most cherish -- 
our freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life -- are 
vulnerable to terrorism. This vulnerability will persist long after we 
bring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks. 
As time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that 
until now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. This 
is a new condition of life. We will adjust to it and thrive -- in spite 
of it.

In exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and 
interests of our friends and partners. Still, we will be prepared to act 
apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. When we 
disagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for 
our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. We will not allow 
such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together, with 
our allies and our friends, our shared fundamental interests and values.

Ultimately, the foundation of American strength is at home. It is in the 
skills of our people, the dynamism of our economy, and the resilience of 
our institutions. A diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious, 
entrepreneurial energy. Our strength comes from what we do with that 
energy. That is where our national security begins.

KEVIN GEORGE

ABIDJAN,COTE D'IVORIE
WEST AFRICA

Dearest one,

Although we have not met, I got your contact through the internet and  decided to contact you for assistance. I was, until recently, a final  year engineering student of the University of Sierra Leone,West Africa.  Early in January last year, the rebels
in my country struck our township and killed my parents in one of their attacks. My late father, King Christopher George being the King of the Town was a prime target.

Fortunately for me, I was in school when the attack took  place. I equally lost my only sister to the rebels. When I got home for the remains of my parents and the subsequent burial that followed, I discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited some $6M.United States Dollars(six million united states dollars) with one of the private security company here in abidjan cote d'ivorie. This money, according to the docement, was meant for the building of an Auto repair company for me by my late father,when I complete my studies. Upon the discovery of this document, I travelled to the cote d'ivorie to trace the concerned security company and to make claims for the said money as the only surviving next
of kin to my father.

But deliberatley, I have decided to keep all my uncles and Aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know I am in possession of such money. I have succeded in making the people at the security company believe that I am the next of Kin and all the documents related to are now with me. I do not know what to do with it but I have decided to contact you to seek your assistance in helping me to take it outfrom the security company and transfer it  to your account and help me to come to your country to continue my education and so that you will help me to get the money invested until such a
time that I will be ready to begin to use it. I am really desperate as I am left alone now in the world.Let me know what you want as compensation for helping
me to solve this my problem. Most importantly,Iseriously appeal that you maintain high level of secrecy and confidentiality in the whole thing.
Please you can call me wilth is number 00225-075-03684
I remain yours sincerely,

KEVIN GEORGE

Indeed I am (this workstation is rh7.2 with gnome1.4, it [mostly?]

So upgrading gnome will fix the problem, it's not an exmh/tktcl
issue.

Thanks.

I don't care if the mail is foldered on python.org, but personal
messages regardless of who they're for, shouldn't be part of the
public spambayes repository unless specifically approved by both the
recipient and sender.

Note also that we are much more liberal about python.org/zope.org
mailing list traffic than most folks.  Read list-managers for any
length of time and you'll find that there are a lot of people who
assert strict copyright over their collections, are very protective of
their traffic, and got really pissed when gmane just started
gatewaying their messages without asking.

Which might be an appropriate for their lists, but not for ours (don't
think I'm suggesting we do the same -- I /like/ our laissez-faire
approach).

But for personal email, we should be more careful.

Date: Not supplied

We're trying to decide if FogBUGZ[1] 3.0 should support custom fields. 
Historically, I am opposed to custom fields in principle, because they get 
abused. People add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything 
they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to Harvard. 
End result: people don't enter bugs, which is much, much worse than not 
capturing all that information. You can always ""page fault"" to get the 
information if the original report forgot it. Rather than having a field in 
every bug where you enter the version numbers of every DLL on your machine 
(this is an actual customer request), information which is likely to be 
relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs, why not just have the 
programmer-assignee look at the bug first, and if they think it might be 
dll-version-related, only _then_ bounce the bug back to the originator asking 
for the DLL info? Similarly, it's always tempting to add a field in which you 
ask for the OS version in which the bug occurred. This sounds logical, but 
trust me: adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing 
only: reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first 
place. Only a small percentage of bugs are really OS dependant and you can 
always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be 
relevant. (But then how do you search for, say, all bugs which only happen on 
Windows 98SE? Aha! You can't. Ever. Even with the custom field. Because not 
every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system, so 
this search doesn't make sense in the first place. The info wasn't captured. Do 
a full text search for 98SE and you'll find some of them. Life is imperfect.) 

Life would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of 
information -- a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in RAM on 
the computer in question and while you're at it, a photograph of the tester's 
workspace. But the goal of a bug tracking database is to _keep track of bugs_, 
which, all else being equal, takes priority over making it easy to find them. I 
have heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking 
package was so high-ceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the 
system, because they didn't know what all those fields were. The _real_ 
bug-""tracking"" happened in email, post-its, and hallway conversations. Great. 

A pretty common question we get on the customer service line is, ""does 
FogBUGZ support custom fields?"" Rather than giving our usual answer (""no. on 
purpose."") over the last few weeks I've been saying, ""can you please tell me 
what fields you would need? We're trying to decide whether to implement that 
feature in 3.0 and we want to know why people need it."" The interesting thing 
is, almost all of the fields people ask for _are already in FogBUGZ,_ and the 
other ones, in my educated opinion, shouldn't be fields. And in fact, our 
existing customers are certainly happy without custom fields. One of our 
biggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company, and I myself wanted 
to add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design, 
but I didn't, and they never needed it (even though they had been keeping track 
of it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields), and they are 
happy and keep buying more site licenses. 

But the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking 
software and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in 
our product. ""Gosh, even Filemaker has custom fields."" Righto. It's true. And 
who am I to tell my customers they are wrong? One person who I was talking to 
yesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a 
built-in field for. This would have made their database confusing and 
inconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved. But 
it's still rude of me to tell customers that we don't have that feature _for 
their own good_, even though it usually is, and we're losing some sales because 
of it. 

Sigh. I guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so 
hard to use that people don't use it. At least we won't lose any sales :)

As game developers reach for new forms of gameplay and a better process for 
implementing established genres, the wisdom of licensing physics engines is 
becoming inescapable. Physics engines do more than just knock over boxes, 
however, and the interface between your game and a physics engine must be 
fairly complex in order to harness advanced functionality.

It seems the older Perl gets, the more willing people are to believe that
it sucks, without any reasonable facts. [0]davorg writes ""You may have
seen the article [1]Can Java technology beat Perl on its home turf with
pattern matching in large files? that there has been some debate about on
both #perl and comp.lang.perl.misc today. One of the biggest criticisms
of the article was that the author hasn't published the Perl code that he
is comparing his Java with.""

This was not a very busy week, with people packing for YAPC::Europe, and
all that... Nevertheless, the smoke tests were running, the bug reports
were flying, and an appropriate amount of patches were sent. Read about
printf formats, serialized tied thingies, built-in leak testing, syntax
oddities, et alii.

Jakob Nielsen on Offshore Usability[1]: ""To save costs, some companies are 
outsourcing Web projects to countries with cheap labor. Unfortunately, these 
countries lack strong usability traditions and their developers have limited 
access -- if any -- to good usability data from the target users."" 

Offshore usability is a specific case of the general ""offshore design"" problem. 
Put simply, software teams are not successful when 
design or management are done in a different physical location than 
programming. Once I actually had a job where I was in New York, my direct 
manager was in Singapore, _his_ manager was in Hyderabad, and if I needed 
any management input I had literally no choice but to go to the CEO because at 
least he was awake during the same hours as I was. You can't get things done 
like this. A good project team relies on hundreds of small interactions a day. 
Here in the Fog Creek offices, we have 10 small conversations about FogBUGZ 3.0 
development every day. 

What I don't understand is people who think it's OK to move the developers ten 
time zones away from their managers and expect good results. Those same people 
would scream bloody murder if you told them that you were going to 
send the whole _management_ team to Bangalore or Beijing.

Mainly they were a bunch of rich people (the white/old/male is irrelivant
but how it happened to be at the time) that didnt want to pay their taxes to
da man er... king. So they had a revolution and formed a no-tax zone,
leading to a very fast growing economy and dreams for all - amazing what
an economy without 40% of everything disappearing to taxes. It was a great
many years before their were federal taxes in the US.

Now we give rich men who dont want to pay any taxes corporations to run,
with enough writeoffs and loopholes that they dont have to pay any :)

But industry analysts say Four little words that can make your investors 
squeamish, put you right in the middle of the hot spot in the market, or send 
the retail buyers to the phones to either double or cancel their big order of 
your game. But who are these analysts? Who anointed them the masters of the 
future and trends? Are they real people?

I just checked out b2_4_0 from CVS and 'make test' fails horribly.

It seems to be looking in my site_perl SpamAssassin code, not the build
directory.

Example error:

Failed to run FROM_AND_TO_SAME_5 SpamAssassin test, skipping:
        (Can't locate object method ""check_for_from_to_same"" via package
""Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus"" at
/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm line
1701.
)

Anyone else seeing this?

Well, I've made an updated libsigc++ 1.0.4 package. It rebuilds cleanly on
7.3 but the *.so* libraries are missing when trying to rebuild on 8.0 (the
.a and .la files and everything else is though).
Do you have an idea of what the problem may be? Julian : Do you want the
.src.rpm to try to find the cause?

So, you're saying that product bundling works? Good point.

And how is this any different from ""normal"" marriage exactly? Other then
that the woman not only gets a man, but one in a country where both she and
her offspring will have actual opportunities? Oh and the lack of
""de-feminized, over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded"" choices?

I actually thought it was pretty funny and quite accurate.  Who cares if the spinmeisters are denying it?

Folks, 

Some of you seem to have hardcoded honor as the default catalogue server.
There are three catalogue only servers running now, and honor is acting
as a nomination only server. Tonight we will be completely turning off
catalogue support on honor, so if you are specifying honor with the -rs
option, please take it out and let the agents discover a closeby
catalogue server.

cheers,
vipul.

Your corpora are biased in this respect though -- newsgroups have a
strong social taboo on posting HTML, but in many people's personal
inboxes it is quite abundant.

Getting a good ham corpus may prove to be a bigger hurdle than I
though!  My own saved mail doesn't reflect what I receive, since I
save and throw away selectively (much more so than in the past :-).

I'll bite.  Sounds like a good idea to strip the HTML in this case;
I'd like to see how this improves the f-p rate on this corpus.

I just finished reading an article about Mozilla[1] for Salon.com[2]. This 
excerpt was rather amusing.

_It is a good question, because in almost every way, Mozilla is a better 
browser than Navigator. For example, Netscape's best new feature, tabbed 
browsing -- which lets you have several Web pages open in the same browser 
window, and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name -- was in 
Mozilla many months ago, and the Mozilla project that created it (called 
MultiZilla) already has an improved version available. When asked about this, 
Yecies, of Netscape, said, ""That's true, but the engineer who's working on it 
[for Mozilla] is a Netscape employee. It was always done with the intention of 
fostering general browsing usability for Netscape."" 
_
Yes, ok, I suppose that's true if by ""Netscape employee"" you really meant 
""Apple employee."" and by ""always done with the intention of fostering general 
browsing usability for Netscape"" you meant ""was done in a weekend for Mozilla 
because I thought MultiZilla was cool."" 

Here's how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened. One night I finally 
downloaded an extension called MultiZilla (go check it out on mozdev.org[3]. I 
was particularly impressed with a feature contained in MultiZilla called tabbed 
browsing. I started doing research and discovered NetCaptor[4], a tabbed 
browser that embedded WinIE. 

MultiZilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that 
prevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree. The first was 
a UI flaw, namely that at the time it had ripped off NetCaptor down to the last 
context menu item. The GUI was similar enough that there would have been 
definite concerns about so obviously copying some of NetCaptor's more obscure 
capabilities (like sticky names and tab locking). The second concern was that 
the tab behavior wasn't encapsulated cleanly into a widget. 

I produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time (did it in a 
weekend) that removed some of the geekier NetCaptor features and that 
encapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other Navigator files 
would be minimal. Once I established that it didn't degrade performance in the 
single tab case, I checked it in as an experiment.

The response was overwhelming, as were the bugs that started being filed. So 
much so that at first I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree. I was 
overruled by Mozilla, which turned out to be a good thing for all I think. :) 
Even with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed 
browsing on the engineering side (and in the Mozilla community), Netscape still 
didn't get it. Netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that 
nobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document. They 
continued to do so for months, simply not getting it. It was this odd curiosity 
that one of their engineers had checked in, and they didn't know what to make 
of it.

Only after the press raved about it did Netscape really jump on board. I'm sure 
Netscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking. Can't you just see it 
now? We'll have a Popup Manager, and a Manager to manage the Popup Manager, and 
twenty-seven preferences for fine-grained control of all aspects of popups. 

Can you believe how disfunctional Netscape is? When their engineers say ""you 
should do this"" or ""you should do that"", they get completely ignored (or blown 
off), but when CNet says ""We didn't like this, or we didn't like that."", 
Netscape scurries to meet their demands. That is simply pathetic.

TREASURES  DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE
MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO
STUDY THE SITUATION TILL  WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER,
LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON
TAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S
CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED  BY THE
FRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY
IDENTITY  SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND
CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM EIGHTEEN MILLION
UNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$18,000,000,00.)  WITH A
SECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE  FUNDS ARE
SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM
KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR
BEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON
(KONGOLO) WHO HAS THE OUT MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I
WANT YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY IDENTITY
REVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL
COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND
NON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. MAY I AT THIS POINT
EMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY,  WHICH
THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY
THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. IN
CONCLUSION,  IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL
PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU
WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING  MAINTAINED AND
ALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATIONFOR YOUR SERVICES.
FOR THIS REASON KINDLY FURNISH US YOUR CONTACT
INFORMATION, THAT IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX

That's similar to using hard-locks (either the old parallel, or the new
usb).

The problem is that that piece of hardware is trustworthy, but the rest of
the PC isn't, so a cracker just needs to simulate the lock/smart card, or
peek at the executable after the lock has been deactivated.

And will run Solaris 9 when Sun catch up with the x86 drivers and kernel.

Although don't hold your breath for the free DVD. It will never come.

(Spot the person who applied for the free Solaris 9 DVD, only to be told
three months later it is no longer available.<mutter>)

FWIW Solaris and Linux seem to be getting closer all the time. I can no
longer see any specific reason why one is better than the other. Expect Red
Hat Solaris 11 any time now... <grin>

The reason appears to be the Google cache feature. I can only imagine the
Internet Archive will soon follow, if it isn't already blocked.

Seems that governments do have some power over the Web, after all.

Brent confessed recently that he had tried to subvert the X
model(s) of copy and paste.  Not in those words... but that
was how I read it. ;)

I have a lot of trouble copying and pasting from or to exmh 
across a VNC link (from things in the vncviewer to things not in 
it and vice versa).  As long as I stick to apps being ""normally"" 
displayed on my X server I don't have much of a problem.

My recollection from my X programming days is that the X model,
like everything in X, is more complex than the human brain can
handle.  It also is very different from the MS-Windows model.
And I get the feeling that Tk tries to ""unify"" those two models
and fails.  Not sure what the exmh-specific contribution to the 
confusion is, frankly.

A.K. Dewdney was the name I was looking for and the column was ""Computer 
Recreations"". Turns out he's still in Ontario and even has some homemade 
Sci-Fi online...

More articles that support my fantasy that Irvine is the
center of the universe.  We've got the corner on electric
cars, fuel cells, two types of Nobel winning physics,
outside the box computer science, and lot of creative writers.

UCI's creative writing department has been in the 
news a lot over the course of the last decade.  Some
quotes from the article[1]:

   ""In 1992, Newsweek called UCI's fiction writing workshop
    'the hottest writing program in the country.' Now it's
    exponentially hotter, thanks only in part to Sebold's daring
    and uncannily timely novel. 

The novel they are talking about is Alice Sebold's ""The
Lovely Bones"" which is on the way to the top of the 
NY Times best-sellers list.  My uncle used to tease me
about UCI (being a USC graduate from '54) that nobody
knew who UC Irvine was just two states over.  In fact,
I used to refer to UCI as one of the lesser known UC
schools, and when I went off to college in 1985, my
relatives told everyone I was off to Cal State Irvine. 
I took a class as an undergrad by one of the department's 
faculty called ""the art of writing fiction"".   If there
was ever any two classes that helped contributed to writing
my dissertation, it was that one which taught me how to
get the writing flowing and my high school typing class
which taught me how to type really fast.  

One of the advantages they cite in the article is that they
seem to take a chance on the ""not-so-sure"" bet, but according
to the article, the number of UCI graduates that have gone on
to write best sellers and the handful that feed the film industry
is creating a viscious cycle that lures more talent which
creates the right writing ecosystem, which churns out more
success stories which lures more talent.

Cool --- I wasn't aware that the US had lifted it's population out of
poverty!  When did this happen?  I wonder where the media gets the
idea that the wealth gap is widening and deepening...

I just set up razor and spamassassin, but I keep getting this error in my 
mail log file

razor2 check skipped: No such file or directory Can't call method ""log"" on 
unblessed reference at 
/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/Razor2/Client/Agent.pm line 212.

I have looked through the archived list and the only thing I have seen 
about this error is a possible permission problem on the log file.
I did what it said in the archives, basically change the permission on the 
file but its still no go.

Any other help would be appreciated, maybe I'm missing something.
something I forgot to run or do.

Pity.  Reading that woman's ad and knowing Rohit for years, they sound
like a match made in heaven.  But why, oh, why, keep that shaved-head

looking rather dashing, and with the crucial hair feature enabled!

My typical Java-to-C conversion doesn't increase the lines of code by
more than 20%, and a fair portion of that is the implementation of
additional features that drove us to do the conversion in the first
place.  Some things are substantially more succinct when written in C
than in Java.  C and most other mature languages have an endless
collection of libraries.  I personally don't use anything beyond the
core libraries of any language that much though.

On a tangent, I find libraries nearly useless for a great many things
due primarily to the fact that most of them are so general that a given
non-trivial API almost always has a context in which it will function in
a pathological manner.  Code reuse is wonderful and all that, but
libraries frequently make design trade-offs that won't work for me even
if they theoretically do exactly what I need.  Unfortunately, it isn't
particularly easy nor does it make a nice simple API to design a library
that really is optimizable to a wide range of design cases.  I've built
a small collection of flexible psuedo-polymorphic APIs over the years
that I tend to use, but it is a pretty ugly solution for code reuse when
you get right down to it.

Well, i saw it on the Compaq Testdrive site, then had to seriously dig on
the redhat site... It's in one of their whitepapers...

I havent used the FBSD poll, as it's not portable, select and poll(still not
100%) are all that exist in the UNIX world. Redhat of course doesnt count as
portable either, but it's nice they are trying. The Windows I/O model does
definately blow the doors off the UNIX one, but then they had select to
point at in it's suckiness and anything would have been an improvement. UNIX
is just now looking at it's I/O model and adapting to a multiprocess
multithreaded world so it's gonna be years yet before a posix API comes out
of it. Bottom line is the ""do stuff when something happens"" model turned out
to be right, and the UNIX ""look for something to do and keep looking till
you find it no matter how many times you have to look"" is not really working
so great anymore.

Is there a way to do a global Sort command? Here's the situation: I like to 
sort by date every folder. I'm cleaning up my inbox from most recent to oldest, 
since I find this direction most efficient (I guess because it helps me 
recognize the significance of individual, old messages). But this adds messages 
to my other folders in the wrong order. When I'm done, I'd like to re-sort all 
the folders I've changed.

Yesterday Viridiana came to my place and dragged me out to look at the sky. It 
was beautiful. Odd colors and light. Obviously we wondered what it was. Today 
Jim explains it. (It was a rocket test from the Vandenburg air force base). 
Very neat. It was a bit too blurred out when I saw it, and there was too much 
street light to make a good photo, so I am happy to have found the photo from 
NASA...

It came out a while ago, but Ben Hammersley reviewed AmphetaDesk and a few 
other free aggregators in his Guardian article, Working the web: Newsreaders[1]
. In more timely news, OSDir[2], a repository of ""stable, open source apps"", 
has reviewed AmphetaDesk[3] and labels it an 'OSDir.com preferred' app. They 
also give you the ability to rate AmphetaDesk[4] on a scale of 1-10. You can 
see the current rating here[5].

Well, that's one of the 10 rpm-related mails leftover in my inbox I just
mentionned privately ;-)
As it's a big piece and needs some testing, I'm just bit lazy about it :-/

I'll try to packages it asap, or at least put up a ""testing"" version first
in case I fear some imperfections.

That's what the manual said - a diversity antenna.

Why wouldn't it work well with one omni and one directional antena? 

IANAEE, but doesn't that count as diversity?

The procmail bug happens when the filter program does something that 
procmail doesn't expect.  Exactly what that something is, hasn't been
confirmed by anyone on the procmail list.  It might be exiting with a
nonzero status, or it might be producing output on the standard error,
or it might be something else entirely.

So Simon is attempting to get SA to run flawlessly, because then it can't
tickle the procmail bug.  This isn't a fix, it's a band-aid, but because
he apparently doesn't have the option of installing a newer procmail ...

What about Tibetan Buddhism BTW?  They seem like an awfully nice bunch

Man, I'm not going *there* again ;)  I'll agree, though, that the ideology
or practices of the religions have very little to do with the conflict.

  | Interesting...I don't think this was my bug.
  | It appears that Msg_Change was asked to change to message ""-"".

Something like that is quite possible, but perviously typing nonsense
in didn't cause tracebacks, and now it does, and the traceback came
from the sequence code...

Perviously this would have just caused red messages in the status
line complaining about my lousy typing.   That's probably what it
should keep on doing (the ""red"" part isn't important obviously..)

I've seen articles on this type of stuff passing through various forums
for several years.  I've always found archaeology interesting for no
particular reason.  Here is a recent article from U.S. News that I

Defrosting the past

Ancient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers, a bounty
of a warming world

BY ALEX MARKELS

As he hiked near Colorado's Continental Divide in the summer of 2001, Ed
Knapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13,000
feet. ""It looked like a bison skull,"" the building contractor and
amateur archaeologist recalls. ""I thought, 'That's strange. Bison don't
live this high up.' ""

Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,
where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a
bisonone that died about 340 years ago. ""This was an extraordinary
discovery,"" says Russ Graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that it
could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. ""There's
probably a lot more like it yet to be found.""

And not just bison. Colorado isn't the only place where glaciers and
snowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru
to Alaskaa trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and
industryhave shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. As
the ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts is
emerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep
freeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the mucky
fringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of our
predecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued.

""It's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced through
studying these remains,"" says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitude
archaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic
Society. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered
in the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old ""Ice
Man,"" found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, have
offered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, as
the ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional
treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.

Vanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before Mother
Natureand looterstake them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains can
deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they're
often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them
don't even realize they're ancient.

That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in
British Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a
dead animal. ""It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,""
recalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. ""But when I looked
closer I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones.""

Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur
trapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Loc
bag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumed
the fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what
seemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunter
lived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts'inchi, or Long Ago
Person Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (who
may be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved human
from the period ever found in North America.

Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could
explain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in the
first place. ""Before this there was no archaeological record of people
living here,"" says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. ""Now we
see that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities.""

Like Ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedek
caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband,
Gerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south
Yukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in
caribou dung. ""It was really odd, because I knew there hadn't been
caribou in the area for at least 100 years,"" recalls Kuzyk, then a
wildlife biologist with the Yukon government.

Caribou cake. Returning a week later, he found ""what looked like a
pencil with string wrapped around it."" It turned out to be a
4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of the
ice patchand scores of others around the regionrevealed icy layer
cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800
years of changing hunting practices.

Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the
ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies.
Hunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discarded
some equipment in the ice. ""We've got people hunting with throwing darts
up until 1,200 years ago,"" says Hare, who now oversees the research
project. ""Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about
1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwing
darts.""

Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. They
are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where
glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to
have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska's Wrangell
and St. Elias mountain rangesthe United States' most glaciated
terrainand in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawing
European Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as
the Ice Man. ""Global warming is providing us high-altitude
archaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We're
probably about the only ones happy about it.""

exmh has a funky cut/paste model that is essentially all my fault.
The middle click sets the insert point.  If you hate that, go to the
Bindings... Simple Edit preferences window and de-select
""Paste Sets Insert"".

I gave it all the thought it deserved <wink>.  It would be wonderful to get
several people cranking on the same test data, and I'm all in favor of that.
OTOH, my Data/ subtree currently has more than 35,000 files slobbering over
134 million bytes -- even if I had a place to put that much stuff, I'm not
sure my ISP would let me email it in one msg <wink>.

Apart from that, there was a mistake very early on whose outcome was that
this isn't the data I hoped I was using.  I *hoped* I was using a snapshot
of only recent msgs (to match the snapshot this way of only spam from 2002),
but turns out they actually go back to the last millennium.  Greg Ward is
currently capturing a stream coming into python.org, and I hope we can get a
more modern, and cleaner, test set out of that.  But if that stream contains
any private email, it may not be ethically possible to make that available.
Can you think of anyplace to get a large, shareable ham sample apart from a
public mailing list?  Everyone's eager to share their spam, but spam is so
much alike in so many ways that's the easy half of the data collection
problem.

Razor folks: is -lm documented anywhere?   BTW, I notice all my *.conf
files in ~/.razor use ""lm = 4"" by default anyway.

Yeah, that'd be cool -- much appreciated!   comparing text classifiers
like spam filters, without tracking FPs, is not good.   After all, ""cat >
/dev/null"" gets a 100% hit rate, but without the FP rate figure of, let's
say 90%, you'd never know it was a bad thing to do ;)

_Sam Ruby_: Stark raving mad[1]. 

    This post was entered in Radio, extracted using a batch file via some 
    UserTalk, parsed using Perl, cleaned up by tidy and a C program of my own 
    design, transferred to intertwingly using scp, and then ssh triggers

Pro-hunt activists target top sight

ONE of Yorkshire's most famous sights yesterday became one of the first
targets in bizarre attacks on White Horse landmarks linked to the hunting
debate.
Villagers near Thirsk could not believe their eyes when they woke yesterday
to find the famous White Horse of Kilburn had acquired a rider during the
night.
In another incident, the Uffington white horse in Oxfordshire had a huntsman
and three hounds added to the ancient figure, which is thought to represent
a Celtic god or tribal symbol.
Pro-hunt activists in the Real Countryside Alliance (RCA) ­ a radical
alternative to the better-known Countryside Alliance ­ admitted
responsibility last night for targeting the two images.
The 314ft by 228ft landmark at Kilburn has been lovingly preserved since it
was carved in the limestone by schoolmaster John Hodgson and his pupils in
1857.
But during Monday night someone nailed on a massive figure of a huntsman
with a horn ­ which had been cut to scale out of a single piece of white
carpet. It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White Horse
Association, who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet.
John Roberts of the association said: ""It has obviously been very well
organised. It was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with a
horn cut out of carpets.
""It was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. They tied it
to bushes at the top and nailed it down. It caused all the stone chippings
to be pushed downwards, which will help turn the white horse grey. It will
not get another refit for another year.
""Whoever did it must have come with a vehicle ­ a tractor and trailer or a
lorry ­ because the carpet must have come in one piece. It was extremely
well planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off.""
The sculpture needs constant work because, unlike chalk horses in the south
of England, it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs
whitening.
Mr Roberts added: ""The damage as such is not great but it adds to the
deterioration, which means it will need more work next time.
""We would have more sympathy if, having made the point, they would come to
take it away again because it was a major job.""
Andy Wilson, chief executive of the North York Moors National Park, said:
""It is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud
of it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. There is also careful
consideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of
vegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. There
has not been a cut in the turf ­ which would be much more of a problem. It
would seem it was carefully plotted beforehand.""
An RCA spokesman said: ""Some people in the country are getting very
frustrated at the inaction. All we want is Ministers to take notice. Marches
don't seem to be doing anything good.""
The Countryside Alliance said it did not have any part in the action.
Spokesman Adrian Yelland said: ""The Countryside Alliance only ever advocates
campaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and
regrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident.""
The incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in
Yorkshire thought to be RCA work.

Dear User,

Do you ever wish you could easily call people you know in other countries
for up to 85% less than standard call prices?! And then to make these savings
without having to subscribe to any low cost calling service?! We have now
launched a product that does exactly that!

You can now call people in most popular destinations around the world for
only 33 cents per minute! There are no hidden charges, you do not need to
signup, use any credit cards, or pay any extra bills! You can try this
service at no risk and choose to use it with no commitment!

To use this new service, simply dial our access number 1530 927 055 and
once connected, dial the actual international number you wish to call.

For more information and the current list of countries you can call, 
please check our website http://www.ireland.pd-dial.com/

Example: If you wanted to call a German number 0567 123 124 you would:

1) Dial 1 530 927 055
2) Wait until you connect to our system and hear a message asking you
   to dial the number you wish to call.
3) Dial the full international number starting 00. In this instance 00
   (for international) 49 (country code for Germany) 567 123 124 (their
   number without the initial zero)

You will only pay 33 cents per minute to access our system with no further
charges for any calls you make! You can also use this service to make
cheap international calls from mobiles too! However please check the
costs of calling 1530 numbers from your mobile if you are unsure.

You only ever pay for the cost of calling our access number which will
appear on your normal bill. However any international calls you make will
not appear on your bill, so you only ever pay 33 cents per minute when
using our service!

If calling from a mobile, please ensure that you do not press the green/send
key again after dialling the actual mobile number, or you will be billed
for a second call by your mobile operator.

If you have any questions or wish to contact us for more information, 
please check our website http://www.ireland.pd-dial.com/ for details.

If you are not interested in reducing your phone bills and would not like to
be informed of any other similar offers from ourselves, please reply to this
message with the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject heading. If you have your
email forwarded, please ensure that you unsubscribe from the actual account
email is sent to. We apologise if this message has inconvenienced you in any

Interview with cartoonist Ted Rall, who has traveled to South Asia recently, 
and has tips on how to deal with bribe-hungry border guards and the like: 

    Rall: Now I realize that's just the way it is, and I know how to do it and 
    get away without paying a bribe, or paying something very modest. You have 
    to show them that you know the routine and that you know you don't have to 
    give them anything, and just have a low-key demeanor. But if you get angry, 
    that's just going to make things worse for you. You get out of your vehicle 
    and you walk up to them -- you don't try to avoid these guys; you don't try 
    to avoid their eyes -- you go up with a big smile, give them a big 
    handshake and sort of rub their shoulders and say, ""Hey, great to see you. 
    You're my new best friend for the next five minutes."" 

    GROTH: Basically act like a used car salesman. 

    RALL: It's exactly like that! You always carry cigarettes. You offer them a 
    cigarette, and you say, ""Hey, what's goin' on? How's it goin'? Great. 
    Here's my documents. How's the road?"" Just small talk, because these guys 
    are bored. They're in the middle of nowhere, and you're sometimes the only 
    vehicle they've seen for many hours. They're often very drunk, so you just 
    have to be cool.

I think keeping the number of middle letters consistent with the correct
spelling is important.  Would be interesting to see if this same effect is
applicable to written forms of other languages, maybe even Japanese romongi.

Barbie has been made over as a Bond girl:  

    [IMG: http://www.craphound.com/images/bondbarbie.jpg] As James Bond, Ken 
    has matured nicely with rooted hair, with slight silvering at his temples, 
    wearing a midnight blue tuxedo, and authentic recreation of the classic tux 
    by Brioni, the famed clothier. Linda Hemming, the award winning costume 
    designer in charge of this year's James Bond film, outfits Barbie doll. She 
    wears a blood red gown with a glittering gold lace overlay and a gauzy red 
    shawl with a gold filigree design. Her gown is cut up the side to reveal 
    lots of leg as well as not so discreet hip strap that anchors Barbie's cell 
    phone. The set is slated for release in November, to coincide with the 
    premiere of ""Die Another Day,"" the new James Bond film. Bond, James Bond, 
    meet Barbie, just Barbie...

BTW:  I remember messing about with such things long ago.  One 
problem I ran into was making sure that no attempt was made to 
play a sound when either:

a)  the screen was locked
  or
b)  no exmh was running.

Just something to think about, Dag.

Good points all but they don't apply in this case.  Someone is speaking and
a group of selfish bastards only interested in getting their rocks off are
trying to shout him down (they are doing it because 'it's good for the
soul'. Kind like Chuckie Manson doing the stuff he did cause 'it was good
for his soul'). Unprincipled and evil. It's got nothing to do with throwing
tea in the harbor or the DoI.

http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsa-xmms-0.9_cvs020630-aap1.src.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsa-xmms-0.9_cvs020630.spec

Also there is alsaplayer rpms there too:
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.i386.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.i686.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.src.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71.spec

Good luck. Both were build on an RH 7.3 box with errata current as of the date of
the build. I'm running (null) RH beta now and I recall that alsa-xmms still works, I
can not remember if alsaplayer needs a --rebuild.

As an aside, alsaplayer is really maturing into a versitile app, I've been packaging
for many releases now.

I've scripted the alsa-xmms cvs build, so it's easy to spin another one if these
rpms do not work on (null).

That's ""angle"" as in geometry.

There were four buddies golfing and the first guy said, ""I had to
promise my wife that I would paint the whole outside of the house
just to go golfing.""

The second guy said, ""I promised my wife that I would remodel the
kitchen for her.""

The third guy said, ""You guys have it easy! I promised my wife that
I would build her a new deck."" They continued to play the hole.
Then the first guy said to the fourth guy, ""What did you have to
promise your wife?""

The fourth guy replied, ""I didn't promise anything."" All the guys
were shocked, ""How did you do it?!"" He replied, ""It's simple. I
set the alarm clock for 5:30. Then I poked my wife and asked, 'Golf
course or intercourse?' And she said, 'Wear your sweater.'""

I am trying to rebuild the recently posted ALSA driver package for my 
kernel.  Although I run Red Hat 7.3, I am not using a Red Hat kernel 
package: my kernel is lovingly downloaded, configured, and built by 
hand.  Call me old fashioned.

Sadly, the RPM rebuild fails part way through:

     % rpm --rebuild alsa-driver-0.9.0rc3-fr6.src.rpm

     gcc -DALSA_BUILD -D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE=1 \
     -I/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/alsa-driver-0.9.0rc3/include \
     -I/lib/modules/2.4.18/build/include -O2 \
     -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686 -DLINUX -Wall \
     -Wstrict-prototypes -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe   -DEXPORT_SYMTAB \
     -c sound.c

     sound.c:41: `snd_hack_usb_set_interface' undeclared here (not in a \
     function)

     sound.c:41: initializer element is not constant

     sound.c:41: (near initialization for \
     __ksymtab_snd_hack_usb_set_interface.value')

     make[1]: *** [sound.o] Error 1

The line in question looks like this:

	/* USB workaround */
	#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2, 5, 24)
	#if defined(CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO) || \
	defined(CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO_MODULE) || \
	defined(CONFIG_SND_USB_MIDI) || \
	defined(CONFIG_SND_USB_MIDI_MODULE)
-41-> 
EXPORT_SYMBOL(snd_hack_usb_set_interface);
	#endif
	#endif

Any suggestions?

That's very perceptive of you.  Many people are not so willing to
accept their personal reality as skewed by their neuro-physiology.  A
great many popular con games exist by exploiting the perceptions of
these states.

Another oft-exploited neuro-plausibility: The brain is a pretty darn

In essence, hindsight justification.  The progressives weren't in the
middle, they were in a society at one end and they wanted a society at
the other end.  The middle is more or less where they got stopped.

As to an intervention that worked, I actually have some nice things to
say about the SEC, at least in theory.  I have a few nasty things to say
as well, but on the whole it has been a very good thing.

Intel also had a similar device a couple of years ago (Netstructure).  They have, afaik, abandoned it.

Intel is still in the XML hardware game though.  On 8/19 they spun off a company named Tarari.   Tarari develops hardware to check the headers of IP packets. Tarari calls 
this Layer 7 processing (atop the OSI model).    From what I can tell, Tarari plans to combine virus scanning and XML acceleration into a single hardware device.

In which world are we talking about?  That may be true for the first sale, 
but once something is out in the world, the ""creator"" loses control... If I 
buy a chair you built, and then decide to give it away to my neighbor, by

Why is it that people don't understand that giving stuff away is a 
perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses?  In many places, it's 
called ""advertising"": ""buy one, get one free"", ""free shipping on any order 
over $25"", ""buy this couch, and get a coffee table for free"", ""free popcorn 
with any movie rental"", ""free doorprize to the first 100 people who enter"", 
""the author will be signing books (for free) at such and such bookstore"".

Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  Just because you 
(and the entertainment industry, it seems) can't be creative enough to come 
up with a business model to leverage free stuff into paid stuff... don't 
take it out on the rest of us.

Max Payne. Elite Force. Theif. Ico. Deux Ex. Oddworld. Medal of Honor. Baldur's 
Gate. The more recent Final Fantasy games. More and more developers are pushing 
the game design envelope, forging new entertainment experiences and art forms 
that draw on the roots of traditional gaming, but also partake of more 
sophisticated storytelling and characterization. For game designers involved in 
creating each successive advancement, these are exciting times.This article 
will explore four different ways to use symbols to evoke emotional response 
from an audience.

There are a few net innovations that have far greater ramifications than you 
would, at first hearing, expect them to. Napster, at heart just IRC with a UI, 
was one. Google News[1] is another. 

In its first day, I've already noticed: 

- The front page changes its editorial stance depending on where the earth's 
terminator[2] is. So in the evening on the West Coast, Google News is lead by 
the South China Morning Post, and various Asian english-language papers. By the 
late evening, the BBC and European papers are kicking in. 
- The site may be created by algorithms - but what about the choice of sites? 
The most arbitrary dividing line I see in Google's coverage is what is a news 
site, and what isn't. Slashdot[3] is, for instance, as well as some very 
obscure[4] newspapers. What about Blues News[5] or Scripting News[6], though? 
- Big companies spend mucho money paying ""clipping services"" that send them 
copies of any press coverage they receive. Clipping services are going to have 
to find some added value, very[7] very[8] quickly.

Why wait until you're dead? I'm sure there's enough carbon in
the fat from your typical liposuction job to make a decent diamond.

Hmmm, know what? On http://lists.freshrpms.net/ the apt-list has been up
for a while now ;-) There is almost no traffic though, since I wanted to
keep that list for apt-rpm on the server side (mirrors, building
repositories etc.), but hey, it could be a good place for general apt-rpm
questions ;-)

X-Spam-Level: 

I've had this binding in my ~/.exmh/exmhbindings for years:

set {bindings(key,Flist_FindUnseen 1 ; Inc_PresortFinish)} <Key-f>

After updating to the current code in CVS I get ""bad key f"" when 
I hit the ""f"" key.  I can open the Bindings... Commands window 
and define the binding.  It then works until I restart exmh.

I suspect a parsing problem/change.  I'll try to look into this 
tomorrow unless someone knows where the problem might be.

This is one of those formally difficult points from a philosophy 
perspective.   You can't really throw out intuition and emotion because 
reason really only gets you answers that reflect the genome and the 
ancestral environment.   Going forward requires creativity and experiment.

My corpus is about 50% spamtrap spam at any given time. Let me know if I
should leave that out next time, I do keep it separate. My spamtraps are
pretty clean of viruses and bounce messages most of the time.

It was a kick when an apt manager kept mailing me a notice that I owed 
them .08.  I just waited to see how many times they'd mail me a notice.  7 
times by the time I left and paid them the .08.  Funny thing was, I lived 
right behind the office where it was mailed from.  (:

compilation errors that prevent me from installing.  Rather than picking
through the code, I thought I'd avoid reinventing the wheel and ask here.
When I run the 'make', I get the following:

cc: Error: spamd/spamc.c, line 50: In this declaration, ""in_addr_t"" has no
linka
ge and has a prior declaration in this scope at line number 572 in file
/usr/inc
lude/sys/types.h. (nolinkage)
typedef unsigned long   in_addr_t;      /* base type for internet address
*/
------------------------^
cc: Warning: spamd/spamc.c, line 169: In this statement, the referenced
type of
the pointer value ""msg_buf"" is ""char"", which is not compatible with
""unsigned ch
ar"". (ptrmismatch)
  if((bytes = full_read (in, msg_buf, max_size+1024, max_size+1024)) >
max_size)
-----------------------------^
cc: Warning: spamd/spamc.c, line 174: In this statement, the referenced
type of
the pointer value ""header_buf"" is ""char"", which is not compatible with
""const un
signed char"". (ptrmismatch)
    full_write (out,header_buf,bytes2);
--------------------^

There are lots more where they came from.  Any ideas what can be done?
Thanks in advance.

Great Village Voice story about oddball museums in New York. My favorite 
weird-ass museum is the Museo de Criminologia in San Jose, Costa Rica, which 
has bits of victims of famous crimes (machete-dented brain-pans, severed arms, 
etc) floating in formaldehyde jars. 

    A stone's throw away is the singular Freakatorium, El Museo Loco, a classy 
    treasure chest of curiosities belonging to sword swallower Johnny Fox, 
    whose focus is the rich history of America's earliest museums, from P.T. 
    Barnum's American Museum to the Bowery Dime Museums. The walrus penis bone 
    (other penis bones on display: coyote, mink, fox, raccoon) is enough to 
    make you feel you're getting your $5 worth. But then you spy the Jivaro 
    Shrunken Head (it's real, it's the size of a tennis ball); conjoined 
    piglets in a jar; an assload of taxidermy, including a gorgeous zebra head; 
    giant's rings...

""MIAMI, Sept. 10 -- A two-gram rock of crack
cocaine was found inside the shoe of Florida
Gov. Jeb Bush's 25-year-old daughter by workers
at the central Florida rehabilitation center
where she is undergoing court-ordered drug
treatment, Orlando police said today.

Noelle Bush was not arrested because witnesses
would not give sworn statements, but the
incident is under investigation, according to
Orlando police spokesman Orlando Rolon.""

Wow, the witnesses would not nark of a Bush girl in an era where there are
no mare restrictions on being held without a cause?

Imagine that...

Hindus mourn 'monkey god'


By Omer Farooq
BBC reporter in Hyderabad

Hundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which became
revered as a divine incarnation of a Hindu god in the southern Indian
state of Andhra Pradesh.


The monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed

Animal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion
after being trapped in a temple for a month by over-zealous worshippers.

The animal was cremated in Anantapur district, 400 kilometres (250 miles)
south of the state capital, Hyderabad, on Sunday.

It had not eaten for three weeks.

Last rites were performed by priests in the village of Timmiganipally in
the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the
monkey was a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman.

Garlanded

One animal rights activist said his group's efforts to save the monkey had
failed because of the blind faith of the people.


The monkey's death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal
out of the temple, but were prevented by villagers.

The monkey, which was found perched on top of an idol of Hanuman a month
ago, attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages,
as well as from the neighbouring state of Karnataka.

Devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it
around the clock.

'Exploited'

Locals said they believed that Lord Hanuman was visiting the village, as
the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of
residents.

But animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being
mistreated.

They filed a petition in the state's High Court saying the monkey had been
forcibly confined in the temple.

The group also alleged that people's religious feelings were being
exploited to make money.

The court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey - but
villagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time.

Curious.  I changed the arguments to Ftoc_ShowSequences to drop the folder 
argument and instead have an optional msgids argument.  Somehow your version 
of ScanFolder is still trying to pass $F.  You seem to have the latest 
ftoc.tcl (1.36), but not the latest scan.tcl (1.27).

I don't know how that happened, but try getting your source tree completely 
up to date.

Chris

Google PR sends a message that they have a new News service[1]. Maybe I'm slow 
this morning, or maybe I'm spoiled, but what's the big deal. I thought they 
already had this. My personal aggregator[2] is better, it shows me what I'm 
interested in, it's not one size fits all. Help me figure this out. I'm sure 
there's something innovative here, I just don't see it.

X-Mailer: eGroups Message Poster

Hello

You may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!

With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!

I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. 

I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:

Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!

Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.

Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".

DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""

Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""

More testimonials later but first, =======

==== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ====
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!

INSTRUCTIONS:

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. 

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 

This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.

1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.

2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.

3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.

4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.

5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.

==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.

Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?

There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!

METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.

===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :
==================================================
 
REPORT # 1: ""The Insider's Guide To Advertising
for Free On The Net""

Order Report #: 1 from
Rui Sousa Santos
P.O. Box 132

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.

** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!
=================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. 

Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. 

Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""

Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. 

The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""

Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""

Apparently the angle on this (i.e. selling without guarantee) is that
software is not a product which is sold but a service which is licensed - at
least that's what I remember reading about how M$ gets away with providing
no guarantee in the U.S. If you're feeling rather deep pocketed, you could
always try suing M$ to get a court's view on the matter.

Wow, that Wilkie article is the single best explanation I've seen.

The open question is whether any analysis before the fact warned the
politicians, or whether the politicians were forewarned and went ahead.  
What did they know and when did they know it?

Here is my recipe for Maildrop:

# Vipul's Razor check
#
log `/usr/bin/razor-check`
log ""razor-check = $RETURNCODE""
if ( $RETURNCODE == 0 )
{
  xfilter ""reformail -a'X-Razor: SPAM'""
  log ""SPAM caught by Vipul's Razor""
  to ""$FOLDERS/.SPAM/""
}

I used this with Razor version 1.  I'm not sure if it was ever used
with Razor2.  I am now using SpamAssassin w/ Razor2.  You may wish to
remove the log statements once running.

I use both.  SpamAssassin (SA) catches things that Razor does not.  There
were enough false positives with Razor that I do not trust it alone.
After whitelisting all the newsletters I receive, SA w/ Razor2 does a
very good job.

HTH,
  Jeffrey

Dear Sir / Madam

If you are fed up of being 'ripped off' by the British government every time you buy your tobacco, then you should visit our website, where you can now buy 4 cartons of cigarettes, or 40 pouches of rolling tobacco from as little as 170 Euros (approx 105 pounds), inclusive of delivery by registered air mail from our office in Spain.  

Why pay more???

Visit our website at
http://www.smokesdirect.com/?ID=2

Best regards

With project budgets in the multiple millions of dollars and virtually no 
margin for error, more and more development teams are under tremendous pressure 
to come out on top of the entertainment software market's cutthroat 
competition. No team manager wants to contemplate dropping the ball when 
creating the vivid graphics necessary to help make a game a success. Electronic 
Arts' The Sims franchise is an excellent example of this pressurized situation. 
This article highlights the critical issues that govern the high volume asset 
production needed for today's most demanding games.

Oh well.  Fair enough.

Ugh, way too much manual labor.  :-)

What I've done instead is to create a tiny little ""kernel.spec"" that
installs no files but claims to produce a kernel package having version
number `uname -r` for architecture `uname -p`.  It also claims to
provide kernel-sources at the same version.  That is enough to make
alsa-driver.spec happy, and at least forms a reasonable representation
of what my homemade kernel provides to the system.  I should have
thought of this approach sooner.

Thanks for the script.  It also appears that the standard logrotate tools
included with many systems (or at least RedHat systems) will support
wildcards when rotating files so something like
/home/*/.razor/razor-agent.log can be specified...

Working this loose knit fashion is what keeps the Mekons so exciting, 
Langford said. ""When the Mekons was our whole day job, it became a 
drudgery,"" he said. "" Sometimes we get bogged down and trapped. But we're 
usually pretty greasy enough to bite our leg off, squirm free and run 
off.""

X-Spam-Level: 

I have been trying to research via SA mirrors and search engines if a canned
script exists giving clients access to their user_prefs options via a
web-based CGI interface. Numerous ISPs provide this feature to clients, but
so far I can find nothing. Our configuration uses Amavis-Postfix and ClamAV
for virus filtering and Procmail with SpamAssassin for spam filtering. I
would prefer not to have to write a script myself, but will appreciate any
suggestions.

Subject: Why is it so hard to get a cab in San Francisco?

A San Francisco cabbie -- generally a well-educated and firm-opinion-holding 
class of person -- has an essay about a subject near and dear to my 
(non-car-owning) heart: Why is it so damned hard to get a cab in San Francisco? 


    In fact, no cab company ever tells a driver to pick up anyone. When you 
    phone a cab firm in San Francisco, your call is treated not as an order, 
    not as a binding oral contract, but simply as a request... 

    So, why don't cab companies ensure that we pick you up on time-or at all? 
    In a nutshell, labor law states that if a cab company actually commands a 
    driver to carry out a specific action, that constitutes an 
    employer-employee relationship. But if a company farms its work out to 
    independent contractors, it can rid itself of costly expenses such as 
    disability and social security taxes. It also means that the contractor 
    drivers can't unionize.

I'm working with an experimental text recognition/processing engine that
exhibits similar characteristics.  It can read right through
misspellings like the above without any difficulty.  And as the author
above suggested, the pattern matching is inherently parallel internally.

If the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anything
like the algorithm/structure we've been working with, the reason the
first letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important is
that without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially
more difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to be
resolved using deeper abstraction analysis.  The middle letters are far
less important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly.

And my IBM Intellistation would lock up instantly .. now this is actually 
quite funny .. if DMA was enabled for the CD-ROM *and* you tried to access 
a CD with Joliet extensions. Otherwise it worked just fine with DMA 
enabled :)

Hm. One could do this with rpm's --justdb switch too, without having to 
make a dummy package, right?

I was wondering that this is a bit dangerous if there is a update for my 
software, as the dummy package might get updated with it overwriting the 
installation I've done from source... Not good.

Is there really no ""--nodeps"" kind of switch in apt-get?

Alberta, and to a lesser extent some of the other Western provinces, is
definitely not happy with the current arrangement.  Some of this has to
do with the strange way the Canadian government is structured.  When I
was last up in Alberta (a month ago), the newspapers were reporting
something like 70% of Albertans favor separating from Canada, and over
several distinct issues.

The problem is basically that while Alberta is an economic powerhouse
that is propping up the weaker economies of the Eastern provinces, their
interests are openly and unapologetically ignored by the government in
Ottawa.  While Alberta sends something like twice the tax dollars to
Ottawa per capita of the average Canadian, they only have token
representation in the federal government.  While I'm not clear on
exactly how the government works up there, representation is not
entirely based on population, and it works out that some eastern
provinces with populations smaller than the city of Calgary alone have
substantially more representatives in the legislature than the entire
province of Alberta.  

The long and the short of it is that the eastern provinces use Alberta
as a personal ATM machine for their social programs while not even so
much as throwing Alberta a bone, and are able to do so because even the
sparsely populated eastern provinces can out-vote Alberta despite having
fewer people.  Or something like that.  The Canadian government is less
restricted than the US government, so they can do strange things, like
having restrictive regulations that only apply to certain provinces,
Alberta being on the receiving end of many such obscenities.  It is
essentially a much worse version of what is happening in the
inter-mountain West of the US.  Unlike the US case though, the rest of
Canada would really be hurting if they weren't receiving all those tax
dollars from Alberta.  OTOH, Alberta would probably thrive.

I have friends in Alberta, and visit occasionally, but I'm not totally
clear on everything that goes on in that country, due to my partial
unfamiliarity with how the government works up there, so I'm a little
fuzzy on some of the details.  What I do know is that on average the
Albertans are quite unhappy with their current position in Canada and
the sentiment has been getting worse over the years.

Cheers,

X-Spam-Level: 

This is not directly SpamAssassin related, but more of a general
dealing-with-SPAM issue.

What is the best way to deal with SPAM during the SMTP transaction?
There are domains and addresses that I know are SPAM at the 'MAIL
FROM' and can deal with at the SMTP level. I have been, and I think
most people, respond with a 5.7.1 code, a ""permanent"" error. That
pretty much means, ""Don't bother to try from that address again,
you'll get the same error."" People often add cathartic messages to
accompany the 550 like, ""Spammers must die.""

But this might not be the best way to go. You are telling the spammers
that you are on to them. This may cause them to try other methods to
get around your blocks. Is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail?
That is, act like everything is OK during the SMTP transaction, but
then just drop the mail into the bitbucket. (This is generally how
SpamAssassin works since almost everyone uses it after the SMTP
transaction has completed successfully.) Spammer thinks everything is
going fine and has no reason to try new methods.

Then there is a third possibility. Instead of returning a 550 code
indicating you're on to the spammer, fake a 5.1.1 response which is
saying ""mailbox does not exist."" This would be in the hopes that some
spammers out there actually remove names reported as non-existent from
their lists. I know, a slim hope, but even if only a few do, it can
lower the incidence.

So, what are the arguments for each? Do spammers even look at _any_ of
the bounce messages they get? The volume of bounces must be
huge. Personally, I'm starting to think blackholes are the way to
go... But sending back that ""Spammer die, die, die,"" or stock ""Access
DEE-NIED!"" (my ephasis added) message can be pretty satisfying. ;)

Thanks Brent: now it's clearer (to me) what's needed. I've used the global
sort and J C Lawrence's re-scan, but there is still a vulnerability there:
If I have an instance of exmh running, the folder I'm visiting will have
its new, correct .xmhcache overwritten with an incorrect one when I switch
folders. I can cron the sort and re-scan process, but I should kill running
exmh's first.

Best would be to have a button for ""Global sort and update all scan caches""
in the exmh More... menu

================This Is Definitely the Answer We All Have Been Waiting For===============

Every once in awhile, something comes along that you just know, from the people involved, from the features, or just from gut-feeling, that it's going to be very special, something with huge potential and hope. When you know it, it rests deep in your bones, and it's hard not to get overly excited and scream it to the world, which is why I'm writing you today. Although this program is launching with all the potential of being as big as anything on the Internet, and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go, I would like to give you an opportunity to get in early before the masses. Traditionally, there have been a couple of flaws to any MLM (multi-level marketing for you newcomers) that have made it difficult for programs to last after the initial hoopla. Today, we have launched the solution to those problems, the newest and most innovative system ever to hit Multi-level Marketing. With a new software system and an ingenious payplan, combined with a 100% payout, everyone comes out a winner. 


The truth is, you've got to see it to believe it, so rather than feed you a lot of hype and tell you this is the miracle you've been looking for, the magic link that will end all your problems, or a lot of other things you don't need to hear, I'm just going to make you a very simple offer. Email me with 'Send Link' in the subject line to:  itshappening@mail2world.com  and I will provide the link so you can take a test drive, absolutely risk-free. You can get a birds-eye inside look, revealing the inner-workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online income opportunities. Should you decide you like what you see, you will have the option of activating your position, but that is completely at your option. This isn't a trick, I'm just so convinced that this is such a sound program and unique but solid opportunity that I don't want you to miss out on the chance to get an early position. With an explosive launch, positions will be filling up rapidly, and you have before you a chance to explore the program before diving in head first. If you're one of those cautious people (and who isn't these days on the Internet), that likes to ""look before you leap"" then here is your chance. Thank you for your time, and I hope you discover why we're all smiling!!


Please do not treat this message as spam. I am a professional and very successful networker with a data base of 100,000. I was pursueded to purchase this list containing 200,000 names of individuals, which is guaranteed to include only those people who have given their consent to receive information. I have not used this means of marketing before and frankly I am dubious about its validity. However, having spent an arm and a leg purchasing it I'm initially sending this message to just a small number of the email address's (2,000) to guage results. If you want more information I will happily supply the link without any obligation. But if its of no interest or you take exception to receiving this mail then please accept my apologies for the intrusion and delete the message immediately. As this is a one time mailing there is no need to respond with 'remove'. Thank you.

Ah, now I see. This is a non-issue here, so I'll rebuild locally :)

That's on a week like this that you realize that lots of porters are
European (and managed to free themselves for YAPC::Europe.) Or were they,
on the contrary, too busy in the big blue room ? On the other hand, the
number of bug reports stayed at its habitual average level.

Not true on the choice part.

After three weeks of me telling eircom that I did not in fact need nor want
their ?1800 worth of router and firewall
nor their onsite survey... for the uncapped service I actually managed to
get a 4 port modem (after asking for a 1 port modem) instead of ye olde
hardware router & firewall and eircom onsite.

I would have argued for the 1 port modem... (which I had asked for), but a
Director wanted the DSL up ... and fast....

Still it only took me three weeks to get (almost) what I
wanted....................................

That's just apt's way of telling you the package is in ""AllowDuplicated"", 
meaning multiple versions of the package can be installed at the same 
time. Yes the output is a bit strange.. especially when there's only one 
version available.

'apt-get install kernel-source#2.4.18-3' will install it...

Note that I since got rid of bayes.ini (it's embedded in Options.py 
now), so search-path issues won't burn you here anymore.  The intended 
way to customize the tokenizer and testers is via creating your own 
bayescustomize.ini.  You'll get burned by search-path issues wrt that 
instead now <0.7 wink>.

Odd. Did I certify that one? What's the 7-digit IBM model number, and
which version of Red Hat were you running?

That idea looks good although it maybe needs to be tweaked a bit more (what
you sent doesn't support packages named ""kernel-smp""). I'd also prefer a
cleaner way than the env variable, and preferrably not editing the spec...
probably ""--define 'target 2.4.xx-xx' --with smp"". Sound good enough?
The BuildRequires on ""kernel-source"" will also need to be removed because
it won't necessarily need to be true, and that does bug me a bit :-/

More ideas are welcome.

That has the nasty side effect of placing all .py files in the package.
What about obvious executable scripts (like timtest or hammie)?  How can I
keep them out of the package?

After the talk at UT Austin, I spent Saturday at the Turkey City science 
fiction writers' workshop at Bruce Sterling's place. Turkey City is a venerable 
science fiction workshop that has spawned many good writers and a lexicon of 
science fiction critical terms that is the de facto standard for understanding 
what works and what doesn't in a work of science fiction:

    Chekhov said that if there are dueling pistols over the mantelpiece in the 
    first act, they should be fired in the third. In other words, a plot 
    element should be deployed in a timely fashion and with proper dramatic 
    emphasis. However, in SF plotting the MacGuffins are often so overwhelming 
    that they cause conventional plot structures to collapse. It's hard to 
    properly dramatize, say, the domestic effects of Dad's bank overdraft when 
    a giant writhing kraken is levelling the city. This mismatch between the 
    conventional dramatic proprieties and SF's extreme, grotesque, or visionary 
    thematics is known as the ""squid on the mantelpiece."" 

    Card Tricks in the Dark 

    Elaborately contrived plot which arrives at (a) the punchline of a private 
    joke no reader will get or (b) the display of some bit of learned trivia 
    relevant only to the author. This stunt may be intensely ingenious, and 
    very gratifying to the author, but it serves no visible fictional purpose.

I had the cold from hell all weekend and I'm jetlagged, but I wanted to get

Well I dont have to worry about microwavers in the house. Ours died a week
or so ago and due to doing some research we will nto be getting anysuch
device in the near or far future. I mean even if one half of the crap it
is reported to do is true it s just not worth it for a quick cup or warm
chai.

Which brings me to the fact that finding a good Convection only (not combo
with a microwaver) oven of any good size is dang near impossible unless
you go up to the bizness sizes. thankfully there is Dehlongi of which
costco has thru thier online store.

Now of course the question is do we get it delivered to the old house or
the new one (yep we got our offer approved and are in the short run down
to a long mortage:)  we close on oct 31. though the realestate agent says
t happens like that a lot, I still find it incrediably jolting to have
found a house inthe hood I want with the space dawn wants on sunday and we
are signing papers on tuesday night with a close at the end of the month.

Which of course means....wifi land for wsmf:)- )

So far I like the Linksys dsl/cable router all in one wifi ap. The Dlink
has the funky 22mb stuff IF you use all thier stuff across the net and the
way things go I cant say thats gonna happen for sure. Pluse the Linksys
stuff is all over the mass market sotres so I cna walk home with parts at
any time.

The fun now comes with a realization that with ATTbi cable as my main hose
tot he net offering up bwf might be a tad problematic....So i am thinking
of ways around/through/under that. the setup of the particualrs are far
form set in stone...any ideas would be welcome.

Also any portlanders.....party time.

Nope.  Regenerate the cache in the script

		sortm +$f

My tendency is to say that we shouldn't tweak at all.

First Blood is Spilled at Record Industry Hearings[1]. &#8220;In a shocking 
statement made by Back Street Boy, Kevin Richardson, he testified that they 
have NEVER received a royalty check, and that they only took a large advance 
after their third hit album in a row failed to earn them a penny in 
royalties.&#8221;

If I have any RPMS in

http://www.dudex.net/rpms/

that could be useful to some one with a real apt repository or someone who wants to
maintain a package, be it known I am not selfish :)

I found stuff I thought would later get popular so I would not have to maintain the
RPMs for them after they hit the big time. Gnump3d is an exapmple of this.

So if anyone is psyched, go for it. If so, let me know so I can get the RPMs from
you in the future.

After a bit of peeking through the exmh tcl and playing with tcl a bit, I got 
the ""catchup unseen messages before cur"" procedure working.  Here's the code 
for everybody and the list archives in case anyone wants it in the future.  
Thanks to John R. LoVerso for putting me on the right track.  

proc My_Mark2CurSeen {} {
    global exmh pick msg
    set results {}
    Exmh_Status ""Clearing unseen up to cur..."" red
    Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)
    set unseen [Mh_Unseen $exmh(folder)]
    foreach elem $unseen {
         if { $elem < $msg(id) } {
            lappend results $elem
         }
    }
    set pick(ids) $results
    busy PickMarkSeen
    Exmh_Status ok blue
}

If you want to use this, stick it in your .tk/exmh directory, run auto_mkindex 
on it and add the following lines to your .exmh/exmh-defaults:
*Fops.more.m.uentrylist:        ketchup
*Fops.more.m.l_ketchup:         Catch-up all before current
*Fops.more.m.c_ketchup:         My_Mark2CurSeen

Thanks for the script.  It also appears that the standard logrotate tools
included with many systems (or at least RedHat systems) will support
wildcards when rotating files so something like
/home/*/.razor/razor-agent.log can be specified...

""rssflowersalignright""A productive thread[1] on RSS-DEV confronts the 
negativeness about RSS 2.0[2] head-on. This will go someplace interesting.  

I left a big hint there in the way the blogChannel module[3] is designed, 
patterned after the Syndication module[4] designed by the RDF folk. In other 
words, the place where they're expressing discomfort with RSS 2.0 is where they 
can make it their own. Lead. Instead of feeling disempowered, be powerful.  

At one point I saw clearly where the compromise between RSS 0.9x and 1.0 was. 
We could have gotten there in early 2001, so instead we get there in late 2002. 
So what, not a big deal. Think about how much better it will be _when we're all 
advocating the same format._ Visualize peace. That's basically what I did when 
I did the 2.0 spec. I know it's hard to swallow, but swallow anyway. If I did 
it, you can too.

This is a good thing.  Getting hammered for stupid investments is likely
to result in smarter investments in the future.  Nobody is supposed to
win all the time, particularly not people who don't do due diligence. 
""A fool and his money are soon parted"" and all that.  It isn't the job
of the FTC/SEC/IRS/etc to make sure you invest your money wisely (and I
have grave doubts that they could even if it was their job).

So what?  Nobody is guaranteed employment.  Laying people off is not a
crime nor is it immoral.  Companies don't exist to provide employment,
nor should they.  The closest we have to such a thing in the US is a
Government Job, and look at the quality THAT breeds.

Perhaps it is just a matter of personal preference, but I'd rather not

So, d'ya remember that whole CSS debate that flared up about six months ago? 
(Actually, it flares up continuously in various circles. In fact, I think it's 
about time for it to flare up again in weblogging circles. These things are 
inexorably cyclical. CSS-vs-tables is the hemorrhoid of the web design world. 
But I digress.) 

If you were around back then, you will no doubt recall that I was in the 
pro-CSS camp[1]. 

So anyway, d'ya remember that argument that went something like &#8220;you 
should design with web standards and CSS because it will future-proof your site 
for the pie-in-the-sky future when people surf the web on mobile 
devices&#8221;? Well, it's crap[2]. 

There are lots of good arguments for designing with web standards and CSS: 
automatically print-friendly pages[3], dynamic style switchers[4], reduced 
bandwidth[5], and aiding and abetting accessibility[6] (a topic which I claim 
to know a lot about[7]), among others. But &#8220;because it'll future-proof 
your site for the next generation of mobile devices&#8221; is not one of them. 
The theory is solid, but apparently nobody told the makers of the mobile 
devices (now that we have them) how it was all supposed to work in practice.

Wishful thinking. People are just bigger dickheads now. Culture is changing
and it is becoming acceptable to get in peoples face and shout them down
when you disagree with them.  The people that do this are NOT
disenfranchised. They
get their rocks off on being disagreeable assholes. The act of protesting is
more important than the actual issue being protested for most of these
people.

And where does this end? Shouting down speakers is an obviously stupid
tactic if they are -really- interested in advocating change. Are they such
clueless social morons that they don't see this or are they just interested
in stroking their pathetic egos?

OBTW, 'clueless social moron syndrom' does not have political boundaries.

This is exactly what I think. SpamAssassin has always been conservative
about adding unproven RBLs and such, and this should be the same.

I say start it with a zero score and put it in 70_cvs_rules_under_test like
any other unproven rule. Then score it based on actual results, not
promises. My corpus does not yet contain a single non-spam (or spam) message
with a Habeas mark. Based on that, it doesn't impress me and it wouldn't
impress the GA either. Rules with exactly the same statistics are being
dropped from SA right now, and I don't see why this should be any different.

right Mike,

i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart.  my opinion is
only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications ('instant
show') that we cross easily (though you are right as rain on pricing).  i am
mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting.

my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways
once there are a billion 'eye's' which can instantly share what they see
amongst each other.  that doesn't mean that people will stop talking on
their phones, or that people will spend more time w/images than voice.  just
that it is fundamental.  from news to crime to privacy to dating to family
life to bloopers and practical jokes, i believe there will be an explosion
of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of
their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of
photography by orders of magnitude and in short order. and yes, changes
things 'big time'.

rgds,
rob

This does nothing to answer my question.  I *do* care about content.  Hell,
if I could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth
all day, I'd have a different opinion of this.  I just am not convinced
that they will (stupid or not).

While a picture may be worth a thousand words (and this is the same
argument the guy who works for me made), how many people do you know who
communicate by pictures?  Sure, it sounds nice to say that a picture is
such an efficient messaging mechanism, but how often do you actually find
yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something?

I don't buy it.

For most messages, text works fine and is the most efficient
mechanism.  For some messages, pictures do the job, but I would say not
nearly as often as words.  Why do you think Pictionary and Charades and
such are games?  Because images are usually not the most efficient way to
get a message across.

Again, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with ""you just
don't understand kids today, and they'll run with this"").  I wasn't saying
that MMS wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn't
easy.  I was saying that I couldn't see why people would use it in a way
that ""changed the face of communications"".

I'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) why
people would want to do this.  Sure, if they integrate cameras into the
phone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly see
people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to
other people.  But, mostly, I don't see what the benefit is to this over
sending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (or
offline) photoalbum.

I don't think 1 hour photos are trivial.  People want to see their own pics
right away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots.  That's
one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on.  The instant
view part.  I'm guessing your argument is that people not only want
""instant view"", but also ""instant show"".  Which is what this service
offers.  I'm not convinced that most people want ""instant show"".  I think
people like to package their pictures and show them.  That's why people put
together fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while
they explain every picture.  Sure, occasionally ""instant show"" is nice, but
it's just ""nice"" on occasion.  I still can't see how it becomes a integral
messaging method.

What's the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it
from one phone to another?  There has to be *some* benefit, even if it's
silly if people are going to flock to it.

I'm searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet.

The *only* really intriguing idea I've heard about things like MMS lately
are Dan Gillmor's assertion that one day in the near future some news event
will happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile
phones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of
what happened - before the press even gets there.

Willing to be proven wrong,
Mike

PS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as
they currently are, then MMS is *never* going to catch on.

According to my son, it was actually Homer Simpson, who claimed the 
French had no word for victory.

http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/americas/08/26/peru.mother.reut/index.html

LIMA, Peru (Reuters) -- Lina Medina's parents thought their 5-year-old daughter had a huge abdominal tumor and when shamans in their remote village in Peru's Andes could find no cure, her father carried her to hospital. 

Just over a month later, she gave birth to a boy. 

Aged 5 years, seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by Caesarean section in May 1939, Medina made medical history, and is still the youngest known mother in the world. 

At the time, Peru's government promised aid that never materialized. Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as ""Little Chicago."" 

Now 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40. 

But a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina's story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance. 

""The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care,"" Jose Sandoval, author of ""Mother Aged 5,"" told Reuters. 

""We still have time to repair the damage done to her. That's my fundamental objective,"" he added. 

'Totally willing to help'
Sandoval has raised Medina's case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible. 

""We're totally willing to help her,"" said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda. But Suni Ramos, of the social action department of Karp's office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family. 

Medina's husband, Raul Jurado, told Reuters his wife remained skeptical. ""She got no help (in 1939) that I know about,"" he said. ""She thinks governments never deliver. Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true."" 

Jurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had turned down Reuters' request for an interview. 

Medical rarity
No one has ever established who was the father of Medina's child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped. 

One of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo, an Andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in Peru's poorest province, Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, Sandoval said. 

He said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs. 

Her swelling stomach worried her parents. ""They thought it was a tumor,"" he said. But shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, Pisco. 

There came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant. 

Her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case. 

Sandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a U.S. businessman, which was turned down. 

More offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on May 14, 1939 -- Mother's Day. 

One offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World's Fair in New York. Another, from a U.S. business that the family accepted in early June 1939, was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case. The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort. 

But within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that Medina and her baby were in ""moral danger,"" and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them. 

But Sandoval said: ""It abandoned the case after six months ...It did absolutely nothing for them."" 

Happy ending?
Though physically mature, Medina -- who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse. 

Medina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again. 

After taunting from schoolmates, Gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother. 

He died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body's bone marrow, but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young. 

Medina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. Her second child now lives in Mexico. 

She appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. ""We just want to get on with our lives, that's it,"" said Jurado, adding he thought ""absolutely nothing"" of the fact his wife was the world's youngest mother. 

He said the couple's main concern now, if the government's offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site. 

He said its value was ""more or less $25,000"" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves' paradise. 

""If the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property,"" he said. 

As for Sandoval, he said he was optimistic that Medina's story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. ""I believe there will be a happy ending,"" he said. 

""As a result of the war, corporations have now been enthroned and an era
of corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of the
country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the
prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands
and the Republic is destroyed.""
Abraham Lincoln (Nov 21, 1864 in a letter to Col. William F Elkins)

Read the article.  I'm afraid I don't understand how the transmission
prices could have hit $50/tcf.

But I'm also really leery of telling a pipeline company they have to run
a pipeline at a higher pressure and that they should forego maintenance.
We had a big pipeline explosion up here awhile ago.

So maybe the judge has a point.  We'll see as the appeals work its way
out.

Gary Lawrence Murphy:
>OK, but only if you also meant religious and alcoholic extremes ;)

Since it was my quip, I'll point out that I used
the term ""alcoholism,"" implying addiction. I
drink. I'm not an alcoholic. Most people who drink
don't go to AA meetings. Most people who go to AA
meetings do (try very hard) not to drink.

As to religion, I think it is harmful and risky in
almost any degree. Were I single, I might consider
potential mates who partook of the less irrational
or more light-hearted religions. A Unitarian or
Buddhist might be an example of the first, a Wiccan
of the second. But someone who is both irrational
and serious about that irrationality strikes me as
a bad choice of partner, moreso than someone who
was addicted to some drug. Alcoholics and drug
addicts at least have the sense to battle their
problem, and to keep their children from suffering
it. The religious revel in their irrationality,
and want to raise their children in it. That's a
difficult difference for two parents to
reconcile.

Fortunately, I am long and happily enamored of
someone who has no religious tendencies.

I recently cleaned my spam corpus from them but these are my current 
results:
   OVERALL        SPAM     NONSPAM  NAME
     13929         995       12934  (all messages)
        13          13           0  T_TRAFFICMAGNET

I put it into cvs_rules_under_test, let's see what the 2.41 GA run thinks 
about it :)

There must be *some* way of tracking a spammer down, since they are planning 
on making money from the spam.  What a court would consider evidence of being 
the spammer is another question.

  | hmmm, I assume you're going to report this to the nmh folks?

Yes, I will, sometime, after I look at the nmh sources and see what
they have managed to break, and why.

But we really want exmh to operate with all the versions of nmh that
exist, don't we?   The patch to have exmh do the right thing, whether this
bug exists, or not, is trivial, so I'd suggest including it.

Patch follows ...

I have no idea why the sequences were being added after the message list
before, not that it should make any difference to nmh (or MH).   But since
I stopped doing that, the variable ""msgs"" isn't really needed any more,
rather than assigning $pick(msgs) to msgs, and then using $msgs the code
could just use $pick(msgs) where $msgs is now used.   This is just a
frill though, so I didn't change that.

Pro football players are addicted to football games, as a means of 
wish-fulfillment -- by ""managing"" the team, they can be free of the rule of 
their coaches and bosses. Maybe this explains the amazing success of The Sims, 
which, on the face of it, should be dull as hell: While away your free time 
away from the office by simulating an existence as a shlub with a day-job and a 
drive to acquire consumer goods on credit. You'd think it'd be the last thing 
you want to do. But it's not. When you're a Sim, you can tweak your existence a 
smidge, discover what life would be like if you took Path A instead of Path B, 
try the alternate universe on for size. The idea of football players playing 
themselves in licensed video games is neat and recursive, like the episode of 
the Simpsons when Mr. Burns runs into Krusty buying Krusty-O's at the 
supermarket and asks where he can find the ""Burns-O's."" 

    ""It's always a trip,"" Carr says. ""The first time I saw myself in a video 
    game was in college (at Fresno State) when I walked into a Best Buy store 
    and some kid was playing with me. That kind of trips you out a little bit."" 
    

    For every 12-year-old kid who spends countless hours in front of a 
    television playing video games, there's a group of 300-pound offensive 
    linemen challenging each other at everything from Madden NFL 2003 to the 
    action-packed ""Halo: Combat Evolved.""

Good idea!

This could also be a job for P2P; lots of people would love to
devote their spare cycles, bandwidth, and unblocked IP addresses
to giving the Chinese unfettered net access.

In a sense, this is what the ""peek-a-booty"" project does:

   http://www.peek-a-booty.org

But let's play out the next few moves:

Good Guys: Google enables SSL access
 Bad Guys: Chinese government again blocks all access to Google domains
Good Guys: Set up Google proxies on ever-changing set of hosts (peek-a-booty)
 Bad Guys: Ban SSL (or any unlicensed opaque traffic) at the national firewall
Good Guys: Hide Google traffic inside other innocuous-looking activity
 Bad Guys: Require nationwide installation of client-side NetNannyish
           software
Good Guys: Offer software which disables/spoofs monitoring software
 Bad Guys: Imprison and harvest organs from people found using
           monitoring-disabling-software

...and on and on.

The best we can hope is that technological cleverness, by raising the
costs of oppression or by provoking intolerable oppression, brings
social liberalization sooner rather than later.

Subject: How about subsidizing SSL access to Google?


[a cheeky letter to the editors of the Economist follows, along with the
article I was commenting on... Rohit]

In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week (""The
Search Goes On"", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most
subversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, which
merely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By
maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web,
if you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like.

The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce
these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from
Google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all
Web browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to
SSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle;
censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in
China. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of
IP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in
the article.

Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic
costs real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free
flow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governors
sponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest
of the Web?

To date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector
programming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just
imagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure
access to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom
of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most
of it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.

On second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting*
the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind...

China backtracks on banning Googleup to a point

Sep 19th 2002 | BEIJING
 From The Economist print edition

IN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine,
is gougou, meaning doggy. For the country's fast-growing population of
Internet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving
an elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked
access to Google from Internet service providers in Chinaapparently
because the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to
forbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been
restored.

An unusual climbdown by China's zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More
sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to
use Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government.
Access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by
Google as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for
Chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.

After the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users
posted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move.
Their anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet
providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site
to far less powerful search engines in China.

Duncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm,
BDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to
censor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking
individual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be
filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key
words that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this
week when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search on
Google for Falun Gonga quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in China
usually aborted before all the results had time to appear. Such a search
also rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes.

       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.
       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.
        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.
        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.
        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.
        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.
        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.
        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. 
        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.
         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. 
         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.
         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.
          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.
          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?

This is the bottom line.  If you can GIVE AWAY CD's for FREE to people (like 80-100 in one month) and then let ME talk to them FOR you - if you can GIVE AWAY free product samples -  then YOU can earn $5,000 in the next 30 - 45 days.

Think I'm kidding?  We earned PRECISELY $26,087.58 in our first 94 days doing JUST that - and we scanned our checks online for you to see them with your own eyes!  We've TWEAKED things a little because WE DON'T WANT you to talk to ANYONE.  WE WANT to talk to people FOR YOU.

if you are ....
VERY BUSY or,
Aren't GOOD AT TALKING TO PEOPLE or,
DON'T WANT to talk to people....

Then let US work FULL TIME for you.  We've helped others....
   Julie P. earned $750 in one week with us
   Jeff A. earned $6500 in 5 weeks with us

And we NOW have an EXACT business plan for you and can tell you EXACTLY what to expect with where you're starting.  No guesswork - we've done it.

And if you DO want to seriously evaluate this, we would be HAPPY to even fly you to Los Angeles at OUR expense to get a closer look!  NO KIDDING!

Date: Not supplied

I've been snowed under for the last four weeks, working on the FogBUGZ 3.0 
Setup program. 

For various reasons none of the commercial setup toolkits (Wise, InstallShield, 
Windows Installer) could do even 25% of what our setup program needed to do, so 
I ended up writing it from scratch. VC++ and MFC all the way. It took longer 
than I expected because I had this weird conviction that the entire setup 
process should be completely reversable, and as you go backwards through the 
wizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already 
made. So even if you're looking at the last screen, if you decide you want to 
change where to extract the files, you can just back up and change it and 
everything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the 
Windows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted 
are ungranted and the SQL database you made is unmade and so on. The end result 
is a great setup program, but it may be a tad overkill. If I have time I'll 
write more about what I learned. 

  

One benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that I don't have to 
have someone else's stupid cartoon-of-a-computer-and-floppy-disks in the upper 
right hand corner. I used a photograph of the London Skyline, currently 
infested with cranes. I took the picture from the cafe at the Tate Modern.

This is something new, or at least new to me: 

    Politspam (n): Using a spam engine for political purposes.

In this particular case, to get back at the University of Groningen.
The content suggests its more prank than vigilante activism (in the
old days we used to say ""someone left their terminal unguarded"")
but what's interesting is that it's not trying to sell me anything
or lead me to any for-fee service, it's just trying to spread
a meme that RUG is evil.

Has anyone else started to receive either consumer vigilante or
political activism messages via spam methods?

20021003@06:00 PDT [TIX106448] (fwd)


Hello,

I have just spoken with an UUnet technician at 11:23 PDT and he was unable
to provide me with any new information regarding the outage.  He did
confirm that problems had spread beyond the east coast and are now seen
nationwide through out their network.  They are currently working with
their hardware vendor to try and isolate the issue.

A large number of Internap's connections to UUnet remain shutdown and
traffic is being routed over alternate providers.  The scale of this
outage is causing a large number of peering points with UUnet and other
providers to be flooded due to the large traffic shifts.

If you have problems reaching specific sites please send an email to
noc@internap.com containing a traceroute and source/destination IP
addresses and we will investigate.  If it is possible will will attempt to
move specific prefixes onto an alternate provider leaving an Internap PNAP
if that will provide better performance.

Regards,
Andrew

Subject: [EVENT NOTIFICATION] UUnet North American Backbone Problems
    [TIX106448]


UUnet is currently experiencing a large number of problems in their North
American backbone.  Internap has been aware of these problems since approx
06:00 PST.  Most of the problems appear to be concentrated on the East
Coast but we have reports of problems from other geographic regions.

This is being tracked under Internap ticket 106448 and UUnet master ticket
651751.

UUnet currently does not have any ETA for a fix for this event.

If you have issues reaching a specific site please send an email to
noc@internap.com with a traceroute showing the path which has a problem.

Internap has shutdown peerings to UUnet is various cities to help reduce
the number of problems that customers will experience.

Regards,
Andrew

&check now un-defangs MIME -- it was screwing up some of my mass-check
results (where SA-markup was present, yes).

If there ever was a warning about SA-markup in mass-check, it never
worked for me.

get around it in SA 2.41 on the spamassassin-talk list. :)

It seems like ATTWS will offer a service that'll tell you where your friends 
(or children or spouse or whatever) are ... I haven't seen it announced, but 
from their ""Explanation of Rates and Charges. ""Find Friends service will only 
locate a compatible mobile device with mMode service that (1) has granted you 
permission, (2) is turned on, (3) is registered on the AT&T Wireless GSM/GPRS 
network, and (4) has not activated Be Invisible. Location services only provide 
the location...

Why is it that I envision Verisign doing something like this.  Yeah, 
like I want Verisign to sign all my spam, er, mail for me.  Pay them 
enough and they'd probably sign spam too. ;)

  | I can't reproduce this error.

For me it is very repeatable... (like every time, without fail).

This is the debug log of the pick happening ...

18:19:03 Pick_It {exec pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace} {4852-4852 -sequence mercury}
18:19:03 exec pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace 4852-4852 -sequence mercury
18:19:04 Ftoc_PickMsgs {{1 hit}}
18:19:04 Marking 1 hits
18:19:04 tkerror: syntax error in expression ""int ...

Note, if I run the pick command by hand ...

delta$ pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace  4852-4852 -sequence mercury
1 hit

That's where the ""1 hit"" comes from (obviously).  The version of nmh I'm
using is ...

delta$ pick -version
pick -- nmh-1.0.4 [compiled on fuchsia.cs.mu.OZ.AU at Sun Mar 17 14:55:56 ICT 2002]

And the relevant part of my .mh_profile ...

delta$ mhparam pick
-seq sel -list


Since the pick command works, the sequence (actually, both of them, the
one that's explicit on the command line, from the search popup, and the
one that comes from .mh_profile) do get created.

kre

ps: this is still using the version of the code form a day ago, I haven't
been able to reach the cvs repository today (local routing issue I think).

How about enabling the ""Show unseen message count in folder cache""
option? It displays the number of unseen messages next to each folder name
(if greater than 0), so you don't really need the unseen window unless
you're using more sequences than just ""unseen"".

Man Threatens Explosion In Moscow 

Thursday August 22, 2002 1:40 PM
MOSCOW (AP) - Security officers on Thursday seized an unidentified man who
said he was armed with explosives and threatened to blow up his truck in
front of Russia's Federal Security Services headquarters in Moscow, NTV
television reported.
The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying, then the man
got out of the truck and was taken into custody, NTV said. No other details
were immediately available.
The man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax and
ITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to
talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, within
blocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded the
man, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the news
agencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside
the building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.
The man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove
to a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities held
further negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said. The
move appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more
secure location.

That begged to try it again but with Tokenize/retain_pure_html_tags false.
The random halves getting trained on and scored against are different here,
and I repaired the bug that dropped 1 ham and 1 spam on the floor, so this
isn't exactly a 1-change difference between runs.

Ham distribution for all runs:
* = 167 items
  0.00 9999 ************************************************************
 10.00    0
 20.00    0
 30.00    0

 60.00    0
 70.00    0
 80.00    0
 90.00    1 *

Spam distribution for all runs:
* = 115 items
  0.00   21 *
 10.00    0
 20.00    0
 30.00    1 *
 40.00    0
 50.00    0
 60.00    1 *
 70.00    0
 80.00    1 *
 90.00 6852 ************************************************************

    false positive rate: 0.0100%
    false negative rate: 0.3490%

Yay!  That may mean that HTML tags aren't really needed in my test data
provided it's trained on enough stuff.  Curiously, the sole false positive
here is the same as the sole false positive on the half&half run reported in
the preceding msg (I assume the Nigerian scam ""false positive"" just happened
to end up in the training data both times):

Hi there,

I am looking for you recommendations on training courses available in the UK
on Python.  Can you help?

Thanks,

        'header:Organization:1' 6921 0.01

There are still two HTML clues remaining there (""&nbsp;"" and
""content-type:text/html"").  Anthony's trick accounts for almost a third of
these.  ""Python"" appears in 5 of them ('http0:python' means that 'python'
was found in the 1st field of an embedded http:// URL).  Sticking a .gif or
a .jpg in  a URL both score as 0.99 spam clues.  Note the damning pattern of
capitalization in 'header:MiME-Version:1'!  This counting is case-sensitive,
and nobody ever would have guessed that MiME is more damning than SUBJECT or
DATE.  Why would spam be likely to end up with two instances of Return-Path
in the headers?

X-Spam-Level: 

Using -lm 4 is yielding an extra 20% a day, but it gets false positives
where it shouldn't.

Such as an email with a Word doc and the signature below.  After looking at
the Word doc, directions to the sender's cabin, I am convinced it marked the
body, which contains no next except the ""IncrediMail advertisment""
signature, as spam.

So I have to turn off -lm 4.  Razor has been getting other strange emails it
shouldn't with -lm 4 on.

      See the incredimail ad signature I am talking about below:

      Fox

Automatically marking something as ham after a given timeout.. regardless of how long 
that timeout is, someone is going to forget to submit the message back as spam. 

How many spams-as-hams can be accepted before the f-n rate gets unacceptable?

I view IMAP as a stop-gap measure until tighter integration with various email clients 
can be achieved.

I still feel it's better to require classification feedback from the recipient, rather than 
make any assumptions after some period of time passes. But this is an end-user issue 
and we're still at the algorithm stage.. ;-)

There is absolutely no way to use a conventional 3.5"" drive with a
laptop directly. However, you can get an external firewire or USB
cradle and attach it to the laptop like that, and any 3.5"" drive
will work in that case.

Example :

Hi, I'm trying to build SA under Digital Unix 4.0f and am receiving a
compile error (and many warnings) for spamc.  The ""perl Makefile.PL""
does OK, but when I do the make, I get this:

Now that I have spam assassin and mailscanner working, how can I have smap
deleted rather than forwarded?

I changed spam.actions.conf to ""default	delete"" but it is still sending it
to the recipient.

Thanks,
Ken

Hi,

Thank you for the useful replies, I have found some interesting 
tutorials in the ibm developer connection.

https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/j-sec1

and

https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/j-sec2

Registration is needed.

I will post the same message on the Web Application Security list, as 
suggested by someone.

For now, I thing I will use md5 for password checking (I will use the 
approach described in secure programmin fo linux and unix how-to).

I will separate the authentication module, so I can change its 
implementation at anytime.

Thank you again!

Mario Torre

Heh. I get to see bad CDROM problems all the time. Mostly when vendors
buy crap cables to try to save $0.02/each, but there are chipsets and
drives with known DMA issues as well.

Usually if you enable DMA on a CDROM that can't handle it gracefully you
won't be able to read data off it relably, and that's about it. No
end_of_the_world problems, and easily fixed.

My biggest beef with automatically setting /dev/dvd is that I always
seem to have a CD-Burner and a DVD drive (or DVD burner) in the same
box, and I usually have the DVD as the second drive /dev/cdrom1 in
""kudzu-speak"". I agree that the %description is the best place for the
tip. Unless someone can come up with a way to probe CD/DVD drives to
divulge their largest supported media size without loading ide-scsi or
having that media currently in the drive.

""I'm a tad furry, so animal rights issues come into play.""
	Robin Williams, telling Entertainment Weekly why he won't do
	nude scenes in movies.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Johnny U: Johnny Unitas was the National Football League's most valuable
player twice - and he led Baltimore to victory in ""Super Bowl Five.""
For those of you younger than 30: this WAS modern football.  The game
was played on artificial turf. (Richard Burkard/
http://www.Laughline.com)

Announcement: How telling is it that the death of Johnny Unitas was
announced by the Baltimore Ravens - and not the Colts, who now play in
Indianapolis?  When the Colt owners moved out of Baltimore years ago,
they apparently left all the history books behind. (Burkard)

Dick Disappears: Vice President Dick Cheney remains at an undisclosed
location.  The move is for security reasons.  The Bush Administration
is trying to keep him at a safe distance from would-be subpoenas. (Alan
Ray - http://www.araycomedy.com)

Noelle Nabbed: Jeb Bush's daughter Noelle is in trouble with the law
again.  When she was a child, her dad would read her favorite bedtime
story.  Goldilocks and the Three Strikes. (Ray)

And further, why focus on the fact they were laid off and not on the
fact they were hired in the first place?

BTW: I saw someone claim that aside from the efficiency of the market
there were also gains to society from irrational behavior.

If a society has business people that systematically overestimate their
chances, that is bad for the businessmen but on net a big gain for
society.  On the social level, the law of averages works to societies
benefit in a manner it can't for an individual.

A key reason, in this view, that the US wound up outperforming England
was that the English investors were too rational for their societies own
good.

(Except, of course, when US investors were bilking them to build canals
and railroads over here.  Thanks, guys.)

=====================

Applied to telecom: a lot of dark wire (glass) and innovation will
eventually be used for pennies on the dollar, the benefits to society
and the costs to the investors.

Hijacker High (8/30) 
Dalal Mughrabi was a Palestinian woman who participated in a 1978 bus
hijacking in which 36 Israelis and an American nature photographer, Gail
Ruban, were killed. Mughrabi has a Palestinian high school named after
her, and it's apparently starting to show signs of wear. Fortunately,
the United States Agency for International Development has stepped in
with money to help renovate it.

And yet STILL noone is out there creating _public domain_ content. Is there
even one person out there can can even begin to talk without being a
complete hypocrite? And no the ""open source"" people cant talk either, the

If the creator didnt say you could have it without paying, it's theft, so
simple, hell that's even in all the major holy books.

Fair use needs to be clarified a bit and then I hope they start locking
people up. How else do i ever have hope of finding a job working for someone
that makes things people are supposed to ... *drumroll* pay for.

Sun Nabs Storage Startup
By Clint Boulton
Amid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in San
Francisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase data
storage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.

The Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startup
with a keen eye for the startup's switching (define) devices and
virtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define),
virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices
into what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that
is managed from a central console.

Though major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likes
of Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus after
scouting some 65 companies.

Mark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.com
that Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible
acquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of
storage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such
as Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi.

""This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7
or 8 system-level players,"" Lovington said. ""Sun sees this acquisition as a
critical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious.""

N1 is Sun's hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define)
architecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a
role in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styled
as the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and
networks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.

While lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining ground
in the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions,
according to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president of
IDC's Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largest
increases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains,
respectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of
$411 million.

Sun's acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of
Sun's 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002.

Test your knowledge with this set of movie quotes. I'll be back in a couple of 
days with the answers.


-  Did IQs just drop sharply while I was away? 

-  Any fool can get into college. Only a select few can say the same about 
Amanda Jones.

-  My dear, since Eve picked the apple, no woman has ever been taken entirely 
unawares.

-  This is Tommy. He tells people he's named after a gun, but I know he's named 
after a famous 19th century ballerina.

-  When one woman strikes at the heart of another she seldom misses, and the 
wound is invariably fatal.

-  I've never been alone with a man before, even with my dress on. With my 
dress off, it's _most_ unusual.

-  You're nothing to me now. You're not a brother, you're not a friend. I don't 
want to know you or what you do. I don't want to see you at the hotels, I don't 
want you near my house. When you see our mother, I want to know a day in 
advance, so I won't be there.

-  Kids: 10 seconds of joy, 30 years of misery.

-  Sucking all the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone.

-  A hundred million terrorists in the world and I gotta kill one with feet 
smaller than my sister.

-  Mother, I do not need a blind date. Particularly not with some verbally 
incontinent spinster who drinks like a fish, smokes like a chimney and dresses 
like her mother.

-  Have you ever seen a body like this before in your life?
She happens to be my daughter.
Oh. Then I guess you have.

-  I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is.

-  Of course, you won't be able to lie on your back for a while but then you 
can lie from any position, can't you?

-  The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that 
it was going to happen.

-  Women need a reason for having sex. Men just need a place.

-  You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You are 
the same decaying organic matter as everything else.

-  Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue! 

-  The issue is not whether you are paranoid. Look around you Lenny. The issue 
is whether you are paranoid enough.

-  Inconceivable!
You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. 

Enjoy.

hmmm, I stole the code from unseenwin, but I never tested it since I don't use 
that functionality.  Consider it on my list of things to check.

Oh yeah, I was following this thread in the sylpheed-claws list.  Very
interesting stuff.  I might have to stick w/ 0.8.2 until aspell gets
updated in Red Hat.

While that's not a lot of training data, I picked random subsets of my
corpora and got much better behavior (this is rates.py output; f-p rate per
run in left column, f-n rate in right):

Another full run with another randomly chosen (but disjoint) 220 of each in
each set was much the same.  The score distribution is also quite sharp:

It's hard to say whether you need better ham or better spam, but I suspect
better spam <wink>.  18 of the 30 most powerful discriminators here were
HTML-related spam indicators; the top 10 overall were:

        '<font' 266 0.99
        'content-type:text/plain' 275 0.172932
        '</body>' 312 0.99

        'python' 428 0.01
        'content-type:text/html' 454 0.99

The HTML tags come from non-multipart/alternative HTML messages, from which
HTML tags aren't stripped, and there are lots of these in my spam sets.

That doesn't account for it, though.  If I strip HTML tags out of those too,
the rates are only a little worse:

The 4th-strongest discriminator *still* finds another HTML clue, though!

        'subject:Python' 164 0.01
        'money' 169 0.99
        'content-type:text/plain' 185 0.2

        ""i'm"" 232 0.01
        'content-type:text/html' 248 0.983607
        '&nbsp;' 255 0.99
        'wrote:' 372 0.01
        'python' 431 0.01
        'click' 519 0.99

Heh.  I forgot all about &nbsp;.

DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
By Scott Tyler Shafer
August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT

DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
according to company officials.

The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a 
family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The 
DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
data.

According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
businesses.

""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
""The XA35 is the first of a family.""

Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up 
to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
alternative.

In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
importance in the world of XML.

""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
Firewalls are blind to XML today.""

Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.

According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company 
itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.

""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
will be mostly false.
Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, 
while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes 
and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.

The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of 
XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
as they pass through the device.

The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.

In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application 
co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
controls the device.

DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in 
May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
focus on content processing and acceleration.
The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
field trails at a number of other enterprises.

=========================================================================

DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.

Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3), the 
industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.

Today, XG3 technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of 
products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
industry-leading customers and partners.

DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, 
drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding

Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer 
in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the 
leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced 
that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for 
this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed 
Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, 
and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPowers Board of 
Directors.

DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and 
sales of the companys breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking. 
Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the worlds first intelligent XML 
networking devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions 
at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services 
and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPowers solutions are based on 
its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3) technology.

""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
DataPowers XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
Technology.

""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML thats critical to Web 
services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A single 
DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
serversbreaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.

""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
laser-focused scrutiny. DataPowers patent-pending technology addresses 
a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
DataPowers unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
performance and security pitfalls.""

""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly 
growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. ""DataPower is on 
their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
Generation Three (XG3) technology was quite simply the single most 
compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""

""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPowers 
XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely 
on XML for mission critical applications.""

Hi folks, I just uploaded RPMS of the new netatalk 1.5.5 released 
yesterday, thought folks here might be interested.  This release fixes a 
nastygram in saving files via Illustrator that I personally have been 
waiting for....

(will be mirrored on rpmfind.net by tomorrow, usually).

Depends on how you want to use it.

The default setup of running it from procmail works just fine, as long as 
you remember to go into your postfix/main.cf file, and tell it to use 
procmail instead of the internal delivery agent.

DOOM 3 will use P2P System?

           i'll-believe-it-when-I'm-fragged-on-it

           Ant writes ""From Page 6 of FiringSquad's
           QuakeCon 2002 Postmortem article: John Carmack said
           something at the end of the Q&A about how the
           multiplayer will be only four players? Tim: After 2 hours of
           talking up at the podium, sometimes you leave a few details
           out. Doom 3 multiplayer will be fully scalable. It will be a
           peer to peer system. We haven't started working on it yet.
           Tell everyone not to panic - it will be fine. John just forgot
           to mention it'll be scalable past four players. It's hard to
           give a hard number because we haven't started working on
           it yet. Right now we're focused on making Doom 3 a
           kickass, over the top single player game.""

Congratulations Chris, you just made the hall of fame!! Speed is much better now. I haven't done any tests, but I'd say that latency dropped 2-3 times and we're back in good shape again.

Well done!

Good way, heres one that worked for me.

Work on a database project with that person. After a while hand her the
keyboard to go get some lunch.

If when you come back she is talking to the person in the next cube about
survivor all the time you were gone...go for the one night boom boom plan

If when you return she has read thru the help screen to try to figure out
what your working on...go fro the week long dine and do with options for
more IF she finishes the help docs and does some code.

If when you come back she has done some  work on the db's infrastructure,
cleaned up your code and made a few  ""additions"" to make it work
better and figures that since you have done enough work for the day  asks
that you bring lunch and your lap top to the big  screen projection room
to watch your new DVD of startship troopers..marry her

When a settler goes postal and kills some Palestinians they are treated
as a criminal, not celebrated in word and song.

But you knew that.

When a Palestinian sets out, to great rejoicing, to attempt to target
children with a homicide-bomb, they are careful to dip the shrapnel in
rat poison.  It helps prevent blood clotting in the victims, you see.

I'm sure all those Jewish homicide-bombers do the same.  Oh wait, there
aren't any.

If the Palestinians are driven completely out, either by expulsion or
death, they will have nobody to blame but themselves.  That won't stop
them or you from pretending otherwise.

Subject: Recruiting for PAIII-IV Supervisor



Dear SoE Community,

Forgive the spam, but I wanted to make sure that everyone is aware that
we are recruiting to replace the position vacated by Gary Moro.

This is a technical position with supervisor responsibilities. The focus is
on Solaris and Linux systems administration with Veritas and Irix experience
a plus.

The posting is here:

...except that I don't see an init script in the RPMs, a sample one
designed for RH is supposed to be in ""utils/alsasound"".  Could you take

It must be so great in the US.  The rest of us live in caves and have
no such thing as free speech.
 
BTW, I wasn't aware that the 1st Amendment mandated that crap must be FoRKed.

The first two are wrong. The first amendment DOES
protect speech the Supreme Court decides it protects
(duh!), and that happens to include most of what
people consider hate speech. Unlike many other
nations, the US has no laws against hate speech, per
se. And the first amendment is the reason for that.

Date: Not supplied

Blake blogs[1] about how mpt[2] wants Mozilla to look just like MSIE. I have to 
admit, the evidence is pretty compelling. I recall someone asking me, ""Do you 
really agree with mpt's Top 10 list? He's quoted you at the top of the list!""

Do I agree that those ten items mpt mentions are the top ten problems? Of 
course not. No two people will have the same top ten problems. Also keep in 
mind that mpt and I can agree that something is a problem without necessarily 
agreeing on the solution to the problem. Maybe we have different ideas 
regarding how to solve a particular issue, but we at least both believe it is 
an issue that needs to be addressed. That's something.

To cover the list specifically:


- Navigator chrome structure - While I don't necessarily agree with mpt's 
proposed default configuration, I do agree that the chrome structure is 
painfully restrictive, and that customizable toolbars need to be implemented in 
order for us to acquire the flexibility to deal with this problem.

- Speed - can't argue with this, except to say that cutting out a lot of the 
useless UI and features from the chrome helps substantially. Reduce bloat, gain 
speed.

- Text editing - if you use Chimera on the Mac, you'll see that the textfield 
widget is easily the most painful part of the entire application. It's buggy, 
slow, misbehaves, and doesn't edit the way you'd expect. This is IMO Chimera's 
top usability problem.

- Message display - Yes. No argument here.

- Search - Yeah, it's a mess. Don't know if it would be in my top ten, but it's 
a mess.

- Menu structure - This gets back to my blog about how the apps should be 
separated. The menu structure has been complicated in order to deal with 
multiple applications. A clean separation naturally simplifies the menus (e.g., 
you can eliminate the New submenu easily).

- Migration - A problem, but IMO not one of the top ten facing Mozilla.

- Context menus - mpt complains about two-click context menus, and yet, the OS 
default on Win32 (overwhelmingly) is to bring up a context menu on a mouse up. 
If you don't like it, complain about Win32, but don't cite this as a Mozilla 
usability problem when we're following the conventions of the operating system. 
(We simply listen for the WM_CONTEXTMENU message. That message fires when Win32 
wants to fire it.)

- Validation - Err, no. Not a usability problem. To the average bear, this is 
completely irrelevant.

- Preferences - IMO this should be much higher on the list. Preferences are a 
tangled pathetic mess. Again, separating prefs for individual apps into unique 
dialogs would simplify things a great deal, but we should also remove nearly 
half the preferences that exist from the GUI. Mozilla is ridiculously 
overconfigurable.

                 Do You Want To Teach and Grow Rich?





If you are a motivated and qualified communicator, I will personally train you to do 3  20 minutes presentations per day to qualify prospects that I can provide to you.  We will demonstrate to you that you can make $400 a day part time using this system.  Or, if you have 20 hours per week, as in my case, you can make in excess of $10,000 per week, as I am currently generating (verifiable, by the way).  

Plus I will introduce you to my mentor who makes well in excess of $1,000,000 annually.

Many are called, few are chosen.  This opportunity will be limited to one qualified individual per state.  Make the call and call the 24 hour pre-recorded message number below.  We will take as much or as little time as you need to see if this program is right for you.  

                          *** 801-296-4140 *** 

Please do not make this call unless you are genuinely money motivated and qualified.  I need people who already have people skills in place and have either made large amounts of money in the past or are ready to generate large amounts of money in the future.  Looking forward to your call.    

                             *** 801-296-4140 ***

The ""--define"" is exactly what I was looking for! I was trying to
figure out a way to do it within the mechanism of rpm (like the
""--with"" switches), but for some reason didn't think of using
""--define"". My computer is currently gone for repairs, but once it's
back, I'll rewrite the specfile, add support for kernel-smp, and email
it to the list for further criticism :)

As far as requiring kernel-source, I don't feel it's a big problem. If
you're gonna go to the trouble of packaging custom kernels into rpms,
it's not a far stretch to package the source tree too (as I currently
do).

Also, I've found that the alsa-driver source needs a usb-related patch 
to compile under the latest test kernels (2.4.20-preX). Are other 
people seeing the same thing, or is this just a problem with my setup?

gary

P.S. If I didn't mention it before, thanks for the alsa packages! They 
greatly simplified what used to take way too long before.

It looks like you're running via procmail -- what are the permissions
on procmail?  ""Insecure dependency"" screams ""I'm in taint mode!"", which
is a typical problem when procmail is setuid/setgid (the permissions
should be 755).

If this is in fact the problem, an easy solution is to put ""DROPPRIVS=yes""
in the procmailrc. :)

Shouldn't there be a w, somewhere in tehre?  Simply setting group and

_Anil Dash_: XML version 1.0[1]. &#8220;Why isn't there a way to syndicate my 
words without butchering the way they look?&#8221; Several people protested 
last week by changing their weblog templates to something like this[2]. Jason 
Levine has more links[3] to those involved. I spoke with one of the people who 
implemented it, and she claims it wasn't a protest as such, more of an inside 
joke. Point taken: the entire point of an aggregator (and syndication in 
general) is to make everyone's words look the same. Counterpoint: the default 
in most weblog systems is to only publish excerpts in RSS feeds; nobody's 
forcing you to publish full posts. This would probably be a good place to 
insert a Zen quote about attachment, but my mind is too fuzzy to find it. 

_Timothy Appnel_: More FFKAR, RDF, and FOAF[4]. FFKAR is &#8220;the format 
formerly known as RSS&#8221;. Sam has already implemented it[5]. 

_Nicholas Avenell_: ESF[6]. &#8220;Are you also fed up with the continuing war 
between RSS 0.9* and 1.0 and 2.0 and whatever else they invent today? Me too. 
So today I invented the Epistula Syndication Format. ESF. It isn't XML. It 
isn't RDF. It's just data.&#8221; Sam[7] would love it, then. But Movable Type 
doesn't support outputting dates in Unix timestamp format[8], which could be an 
impediment to mainstream acceptance. 

_Shelley Powers_: Consumer Rights and RSS[9]. &#8220;I'm not buying into RSS 
0.9x. I'm not buying into RSS 2.0. I'm not buying into RSS 1.0. I changed my 
RSS 0.91 and RSS 1.0 templates to read the following:&#8221; 

    *RSS not supported here* 

    This weblog does not support RSS 0.9x, RSS 2.0, or RSS 1.0. If you wish to 
    view entries, may I suggest that you visit the weblog, and save your fast 
    skimming for the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. 

I'm sure this is some sort of DMCA violation or something, but here goes: 

    import urllib, re; print ""\n TITLE: Burningbird

    \n http://weblog.burningbird.net/\n en-us\n \n"" + ""\n"".join([""TITLE: %s

Your actual serial number is 1519761310 - from a dig I've just done.

Try resetting the zone number to 2002082901 - some of your secondaries seem 
to have a serial number below that, so they clearly regard 1519761310 as 
being less than 2002082601.

That should enable them to pick up the new zonefile.

Actually, it means just the opposite. The first
amendment guarantees Harley's right to say just
that. For the outlets where he has editorial
control, it even guarantees his right to CENSOR
content published through those outlets. The
first amendment doesn't limit Harley's speech,
and it is neutral with regard to the selection
policies of FoRK and other private venues.

Not really.  Try again?  About half the developers on the spambayes project
were missing some permission or other, so I ran thru all of them and checked
every damned box and clicked on every damn dropdown list I could find.  As
far as SF is concerned, you're all sitting on God's Right Hand now, so if it
still doesn't work I suggest you upgrade to Win98 <wink>.

X-Spam-Level: 

This is due to insufficient write privileges to the ""razor-agent.log"" 
file. A quick work-around is to do a ""chmod go+rx"" on that file (of 
course, it's better to restrict the access as much as possible).

In Agent.pm, when the Razor2::Logger object is created, if it doesn't 
have write permission to the log file it does not succeed. Then, later 
in the code when the log object is used, it fails with the ""unblessed"" 
error.

Hope this helps,
Michael Duff

That's the theory, yes.

No, but either due to some technical glitch, or downright just wanting
to do so, people send to the secondary.  It's a semi-usual spammer trick
actually to bypass the main server and send directly to a secondary
since it will either have less filtering, or be ""trusted"", or ...

MX records in the mail world are all explained in RFC 2821, section 5:

[...]
   Multiple MX records contain a preference indication that MUST be used
   in sorting (see below).  Lower numbers are more preferred than higher
   ones.  If there are multiple destinations with the same preference
   and there is no clear reason to favor one (e.g., by recognition of an
   easily-reached address), then the sender-SMTP MUST randomize them to
   spread the load across multiple mail exchangers for a specific
   organization.
[...]
   If it determines that it should relay the message without rewriting
   the address, it MUST sort the MX records to determine candidates for
   delivery.  The records are first ordered by preference, with the
   lowest-numbered records being most preferred.  The relay host MUST
   then inspect the list for any of the names or addresses by which it
   might be known in mail transactions.  If a matching record is found,
   all records at that preference level and higher-numbered ones MUST be
   discarded from consideration.  If there are no records left at that
   point, it is an error condition, and the message MUST be returned as
   undeliverable.  If records do remain, they SHOULD be tried, best
   preference first, as described above.

Subject: [Spambayes] stack.pop() ate my multipart message
Message-ID: <w53lm6985vn.fsf@woozle.org>

I've been running hammie on all my incoming messages, and I noticed that
multipart/alternative messages are totally hosed: they have no content,
just the MIME boundaries.  For instance, the following message:

------------------------------8<------------------------------
From: somebody <someone@somewhere.org>
To: neale@woozle.org
Subject: Booga
Content-type: multipart/alternative; boundary=""snot""

This is a multi-part message in MIME format.

Hi there.

I'm using ""Python 2.3a0 (#1, Sep  9 2002, 22:56:24)"".

I've fixed it with the following patch to Tim's tokenizer, but I have to
admit that I'm baffled as to why it works.  Maybe there's some subtle
interaction between generators and lists that I can't understand.  Or
something.  Being as I'm baffled, I don't imagine any theory I come up
with will be anywhere close to reality.

In any case, be advised that (at least for me) hammie will eat
multipart/alternative messages until this patch is applied.  The patch
seems rather bogus though, so I'm not checking it in, in the hope that
there's a better fix I just wasn't capable of discovering :)

Why?  What threat does Outlook pose to your organization?

More detail please?  I do use sequences, so I'm familiar with their
use, but how can I make indices with them, and how can I keep them
up to date?

You're probably running exmh on a local machine.  I'm running it on
a very remote machine.  In this scenario, the mime handling is weak.

""There has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but the Department
of Justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits against
individuals [1] who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrighted
material over the Internet. Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes
that ""criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to
preserve the viability of America's content industries."" Malcolm also
believes that people who trade copyrighted material think they are
participating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download
copyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions
such as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see
businesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of
copyrighted works.


""Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think
they would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal
prosecution,"" said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same
conference panel.

I'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is
hoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or
warnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor
deterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits
carrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate
further animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to
initiate because of the ""schooling"" effect of millions of systems
participating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out from
the crowd.

The article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which defines
illegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement:


Criminal infringement: Any person who infringes a copyright willfully for
purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the
reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any
180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more
copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000....
For purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution
of a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish
willful infringement.
...
The term ""financial gain"" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of
anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.


Therefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as ""financial gain""
even if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how the
value of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15
to millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the
perspective of the consumer or copyright holder.

The statute of limitations:


507. Limitations on actions

(a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintained
under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five
years after the cause of action arose.

(b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under the
provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after
the claim accrued.

The penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in
Section 2319: Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, first-time
criminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.

I'm still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people to
prosecute because of the aforementioned ""schooling"" effect, but my guess
would be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent
individuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be
targeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers. Thanks to
MonaLisaOverdrive for pointing out this story.

I would be in favor of creating new SpamAssassin CVS modules and

interest and a maintainer).

Gack. Did you try 7.3 with the compat-glibc first? Or does it require an
antique kernel?

Anil Dash discovers that the T-Mobile Sidekick's web-browser is pretty 
arbitrary in which pages it will load and which pages it will throw up its 
hands at: 

    So I decided I was going to modify my page to conform to your browser's 
    idiocy. I went looking for technical docs on what you do to mangle web 
    pages. None. I went looking for a desktop emulator that I could run to 
    simulate your device on my computer. None. I went looking to see an 
    acknowledgement of the shortcomings of your device, indicating that the 
    situation would be improved. None.

Battery pack, huh what???

You dont use batteries for a 1/4 mile run, you use capacitors. MANY times
the energy density, and you can get the energy out fast enough. Note that
the battery packs are fully swapped out for recharging after each run
anyway, just like a gas dragster is refueled, so this wouldnt be cheating.
200 MPH should be no problem.

Interesting.  It's possible, of course, that the shitty economy 
is hurting the spammers as much as anyone else.  But if you've 
been aggressively reporting, then it could just be that.  Could 
be your upstream ISP is being more aggressive too...

hmmm.

Peter.

Open a terminal and as root type
lsmod
you want to find a module called
NVdriver.

If it isn't loaded then load it.
#insmod NVdriver.o
Oh and ensure you have this module loaded on boot.... else when you reboot
you might be in for a nasty surprise.

Once the kernel module is loaded

#vim /etc/X11/XF86Config

in the section marked
Driver I have ""NeoMagic""
you need to have
Driver ""nvidia""

Here is part of my XF86Config

Also note that using the card you are using you 'should' be able to safely
use the FbBpp 32 option .

 Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected 
 By Bruce Johnston in Rome
 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 
 
 Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio, Siena's
 traditional bareback horse race, for the first time yesterday, arresting six
 people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team.
 
 
 Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena 
 Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio
 nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine,
 contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month.
 
 Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take
 part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the
 off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf.
 
 Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa
 did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.
 
 As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his
 mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.
 
 Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back,
 was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.
 
 Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police
 yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers
 from video footage.
 
 Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as
 contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact
 that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.
 
 The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on
 the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade
 through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.
 But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.
 
 The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary
 undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last
 minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not
 grab their reins.
 
 The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods'
 boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend
 Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.
 
 The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles
 of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of
 the Assumption of the Virgin.

Dear Sir or Madam

In the past you have requested information on discounted products. We hope that you find this of interest. If you are not a smoker, and find this email offensive, we sincerely apologise!  We will be only too happy to take you off our mailing list.

If you are a smoker, however, and are fed up with paying high prices for your cigarettes and tobacco, take a look at what we have to offer  by clicking on this link.
http://www.smokersunited.co.uk/?S=15&ID=2

We can send you, legally, by registered air mail, direct to your door, 4 cartons of cigarettes or 40 pouches of rolling tobacco (all brands are available) from only 170 Euros - about 105 pounds - fully inclusive of postage and packing.  Why pay more?

To remove yourself from our mailing list, please click below
mailto:smokersclub@terra.es

Yours faithfully.
Smokers United

The USAF had a program in the 1959-1960 in which successful free jumps 
were made from balloons at up to ~32 km (100,000 ft.). The relevance was 
astronauts and SR-71 bailouts. This would top that achievement 
comfortably.

I know that I did this during the week that all the catalogue's were
hokey but after that I changed it back to discovery.  So I can see why
people are using honor.

Subject: [Razor-users] honor is not in csl


Folks, 

Some of you seem to have hardcoded honor as the default catalogue
server. There are three catalogue only servers running now, and honor is
acting as a nomination only server. Tonight we will be completely
turning off catalogue support on honor, so if you are specifying honor
with the -rs option, please take it out and let the agents discover a
closeby catalogue server.

cheers,
vipul.

Thanks Paul,
That is the way I am doing right now, but I would like to NOT use the mouse 
for such things. Any other clue?

2.5ft lizard 'abandoned' at resort

Holidaymakers at a seaside resort were stunned to find a 2.5ft lizard
sunning itself at a caravan park close to a beach.
The savannah monitor lizard was captured at Chapel St Leonards, Lincs, on
Sunday by a member of the public before being collected by an RSPCA team.
RSPCA officer Justin Stubbs, who took the lizard to a specialist carer,
said: ""Savannah monitors can give a nasty bite and we certainly wouldn't
have wanted one loose in a busy holiday resort for long.""
Officials believe the animal may have been abandoned by a private owner
because it has not been reported missing.
Savannah monitor lizards originate in Africa and are carnivorous, eating
rats and small rodents. They can grow to 4ft in length.
Anyone with information about the lizard can contact the RSPCA in confidence
on 08705 555 999.

It did for me, but I am not willing to say it is not a tcl/tk issue as
other apps seemed to work OK for cut and paste and Tk does its
clipboard stuff a bit differently than most toolkits. So I'm not
about to place blame. Just reporting my experience.

Also, I am not talking about installing Gnome2. Just updating the
many, many pieces of gnome to the current rev level.

Because of this:
http://hrw.org/press/2002/08/yahoo080902.htm
there are several of us who are in the BDSM lifestyle who are trying to 
encourage our local groups to find alternatives to yahoo groups as a way 
of communicating with each other.  I've set up a place to have maillists 
on my server for any group who wants to use it, but I was wondering if 
anyone knows of an alternative that allows all the bells and whistles that 
yahoo has, such as reminders, file storage, calendars, etc.  Anyone?
TIA,
Cindy

Maybe.  I batch messages using fetchmail (don't ask why), and adding
.4 seconds per message for a batch of 50 (not untypical) feels like a
real wait to me...

Correct...

No, they only have to prove that they send several million
emails to 'potential clients' to get their money.  I don't think
they even care much about bounces.  They're con-artists, why
should they care about proving they actually reached people?

Most of the time the bounce goes to some poor soul who has
nothing to do with the spammer.

Yes.

Thanks Tony, but I think doing it using component files will get a .signature 
by default, but I have many diferent signatures and I want to insert one of 
that signatures using a keyboard command. So for a message I will insert a 
signature, but for another message I will insert a different signature.

Is it possible? I am using sedit for my messages.

Thanks.

That's exactly what is intended; the idea is that legit senders who
habitually score just > 5, will eventually get out of ""AWL hell"" after
6-10 messages.

Note that running a single spam through ""spamassassin -a -t"" *will*
eventually whitelist the spammer.  but that's why the man page tells you
not to do it ;)

DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
By Scott Tyler Shafer
August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT

DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
according to company officials.

The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a 
family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The 
DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
data.

According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
businesses.

""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
""The XA35 is the first of a family.""

Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up 
to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
alternative.

In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
importance in the world of XML.

""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
Firewalls are blind to XML today.""

Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.

According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company 
itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.

""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
will be mostly false.
Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, 
while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes 
and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.

The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of 
XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
as they pass through the device.

The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.

In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application 
co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
controls the device.

DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in 
May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
focus on content processing and acceleration.
The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
field trails at a number of other enterprises.

=========================================================================

DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.

Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3), the 
industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.

Today, XG3 technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of 
products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
industry-leading customers and partners.

DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, 
drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding

Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer 
in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the 
leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced 
that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for 
this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed 
Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, 
and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPowers Board of 
Directors.

DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and 
sales of the companys breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking. 
Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the worlds first intelligent XML 
networking devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions 
at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services 
and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPowers solutions are based on 
its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3) technology.

""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
DataPowers XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
Technology.

""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML thats critical to Web 
services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A single 
DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
serversbreaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.

""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
laser-focused scrutiny. DataPowers patent-pending technology addresses 
a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
DataPowers unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
performance and security pitfalls.""

""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly 
growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. ""DataPower is on 
their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
Generation Three (XG3) technology was quite simply the single most 
compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""

""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPowers 
XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely 
on XML for mission critical applications.""

Well, I am checking the packet signatures while building the apt-tree.
Not very pretty, not very fast, but it works.

Nonetheless:
did anyone ever play with this:

a *few*?  Time to update pine-robot-blurb.txt on

Has anyone figured out what's up with this?  Does someone out there think
that FoRK needs some MIME tutoring?

A flippant remark that I will probably regret  - sure there's assholes 
everywhere. I just remember a lunch in Spain with
a semi-famous American - I think we had about 10 nationalities at the 
table, and he managed to insult each of them within
15 minutes. A historical perspective makes me think that empires - 
Roman, British, Russian, American, whatever - produce
 a larger proportion of assholes than subject nations (and are more 
likely to have them in positions of authority).

It doesn't work that way.  A website is opt-in, spam is no-opt.  If you
visit a samizdat site you can get in trouble.  If you get samizdat spam,
the worst that can be said is that you might have read it.  And as long as
the mailers send to individuals who clearly didn't opt-in, like party
officials, then other recipients can't get in trouble for requesting the
mail.  

Plus, it's much harder to block spam than web sites.

But this shouldn't come as a surprize.  Spam is speech.  It may be sleazy, 
but so what.

=== Scissors === 

I, like most other people here, went through the security checkpoint. Unlike 
everyone else, they decided to search my suitcase. The security lady asked for 
permission and then took everything out: clothing, umbrellas, a jacket, and a 
box of crackers. She searched all the pockets: nothing. Apparently the jacket 
was suspicious; She sent it through again. Nothing. 

    The lady in the next lane waved a 10-inch knife and asked the lady in my 
    lane if it could go on. I can only assume she answered yes. 

She put everything back in and sent it through again. Still suspicious. They 
took everything out. It looked like this was going to take a while, so I used 
the opportunity to put the tickets I was holding back in my bag. When I looked 
back up, the security woman was brandishing a scissors and saying ""This can't 
go on board."" ""I don't remember packing that,"" I said. I let her confiscate it. 

I called my Mom. She doesn't remember packing it either. Is there some sort of 
terrorist plot to plant scissors in innocent-looking people's suitcases? I 
can't see why this would be useful. How would they know what plane I'm on? Once 
I'm on the plane how would they get the scissors? They could threaten me, but 
if they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the 
scissors? Perhaps it's some sort of Matroishca-doll system. They use their 
fists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky 
mouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of _A New Kind of Science_, 
they use ANKS to bludgeon a 5th Grader into giving them a wedge block, and they 
use the wedge to get me to give them the scissors. Those are some pretty clever 
terrorists. 

*Update:* False alarm. My Mom called. Apparently it was the scissors she was 
using to cut loose threads from my tie last night. It must have fallen in. The 
nation can go back to Yellow Level Terrorist Alert.  

=== Waiting for Wireless === 

Now I am at O'Hare Airport, sitting outside the Admiral's Club while 
businessmen walk in and out. I am looking for a wireless signal, the signal I 
used last time I was here, but not finding it. Of course, last time I was here, 
I had an Admiral's Club card. This time I have a Mileage Plus Card, but despite 
the airline ologopoly--or perhaps because of it (have to keep up appearances, 
you know)--I doubt they will accept it. 

=== Irony === 

According to the announcement I just heard, Mr. Valenti is going to miss his 
flight. 

I think of what I'd say if I ran into him. ""Jack!"" I'd exclaim, as if we were 
old pals. ""Going to the Eldred case?"" Of course he was. ""Going to be a good 
one."" ""Hey, remember when you had that debate with Lessig?"" I'd ask. ""You said 
you were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the 
Internet. What ever happened to that?"" I imagine him mumbling and looking down 
at his watch. His plane is going to leave soon; he has to run. 

Another announcement: Mr. Michael McKenna needs to call his office. Good thing 
these airline announcements keep me up to date. 

=== Automatic Flush Toilets === 

Now I am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances. In 
the first, at my old high school (where you think some people might be a little 
short...), the flush went off once accidentally. OK, I thought, I can handle 
one mistake. Then it went off again. Here at the airport, it misfired three 
times. 

This is annoying and inexcusable. Have they not heard of user testing? Do they 
expect only tall people to use these bathrooms? This problem must be remedied 
immediately. I recommend releasing a Service Pack on the manufacturer's web 
site. 

=== Arrival === 

I've arrived in D.C.--once again, I'm sitting a block away from my hotel on the 
sidewalk borrowing someone's connection. Trip was very smooth, had lunch with 
Lisa and went to the Spy Museum (pretty cool, but could have been better). Now 
for the meetings and parties. 

Sorry for not responding to your email. I'm rather busy. ;-)

IMPORTANT DOMAIN INFORMATION:


The new domain names are finally available to the general public at discount prices. Now you can register one of the exciting new .BIZ or .INFO domain names, as well as the original .COM and .NET names for just $14.95. These brand new domain extensions were recently approved by ICANN and have the same rights as the original .COM and .NET domain names. The biggest benefit is of-course that the .BIZ and .INFO domain names are currently more available. i.e. it will be much easier to register an attractive and easy-to-remember domain name for the same price.  Visit: http://www.domainsforeveryone.com/ today for more info.
 
Register your domain name today for just $14.95 at: http://www.domainsforeveryone.com/  Registration fees include full access to an easy-to-use control panel to manage your domain name in the future.

Huh?  Are you saying that whoever has the loudest voice gets to be heard?
Shouting down a public speaker could be considered a form of censorship. If
shouting down public speakers is 'protected' it is only a matter of time
before the people doing the shouting have their tactic used against
them -every single time they open their mouth-. The tactic is stupid and
non-productive and if generally used, will only result in chaos.  The tactic
is just stupid ego-bation at best, unless the goal is to generate chaos.
And humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in society
should be locked up (provided you can accurately identify them, which is not
really possible anyway, but hey, this is my rant :-). IMHO.

i'm a very happy user of exmh, but i'm paranoid also :-)
therefore i'm not too happy with exmh caching my pgp passphrases.

usually i use a relatively secure tool called 'quintuple agent' 
<URL:http://www.vibe.at/tools/secret-agent/> to store my passphrases,
and i've just added the few lines of code to exmh which allow for such
external caches.

the patch is attached, it is against version 2.5-1 (debian), and the
files modified are extrasInit.tcl and pgpExec.tcl.

i've added three new preferences in the 'general pgp' section, which
allow everybody to use his/her favourite external tool to get the
passphrase (everything which spits out the phrase on stdout is ok).

i'd be happy if somebody with cvs access thinks that this stuff 
is worth to be added and does so; apart from that i'm happy for 
suggestions, comments or critique (mind you, i'm not exactly a special 
friend of tcl so my code may leave things to be desired...)

regards
az

yeah, I'd be with that -- as long as they have a maintainer ;)

however regarding CVS, I'd say many projects might find it easier
to just sign up as a new proj with sf.net -- it might save them having
to go through us (not sure, depends on what sf.net's procedures
are like).
